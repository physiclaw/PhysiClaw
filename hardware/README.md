# PhysiClaw — Hardware

CAD-as-code for the PhysiClaw machine. Every part, every assembly step, the
bill of materials, and the printable build manual are **generated from Python**
— there is no GUI CAD file to hand-edit. Re-running the scripts reproduces all
artifacts from source.

The geometry kernel is [build123d](https://build123d.readthedocs.io)
(OpenCASCADE under the hood). The manual and sourcing guide are plain
standard-library Python.

## Pipeline at a glance

```text
parts/            standard + custom parts          → STEP solids
   │
   ▼
assembly/         compose parts into ~70 steps     → STEP + SVG line-art
   │  (each step derives its placement from the upstream chain)
   ▼
bom (library)     aggregate parts per step         → Markdown BOM
   │
   ▼
mark/             annotate the step SVGs           → patch JSON + snapshot SVG
   │
   ▼
manual/           assemble JSON content + SVGs     → bilingual HTML / PDF
```

All generated files land under `output/` and are not committed.

## Design

**Parts register themselves.** Every `BasePart.build()` does two things beyond
returning geometry: it pushes one row (`bom_key`, `qty`, `category`) into a
process-wide BOM registry, and — for leaf parts — it caches the built solid by
`geom_key` so repeated instances are a cheap copy instead of a rebuild. Parts
are tagged `standard` (purchasable) or `custom` (manufactured for this build).

**Assemblies derive their placement.** Each step is a `BaseAssembly` that
embeds its predecessor and positions new parts **relative to the upstream
chain** rather than from hardcoded coordinates — a clamp's position is computed
by walking the rail → carriage → joint math. This keeps the model
self-consistent: change a part dimension and every downstream step follows.
Assemblies deliberately opt **out** of the geometry cache (caching a whole
compound deep-copies the entire tree); they are recomposed from cached leaves
instead.

**Two variants per step.** Every step renders both `_exploded` (install motion,
with ghost layers) and `_assembled` (finished state), under one or more camera
angles. Outputs are named `<step>_<variant>_cam<i>.svg`.

**Built in subprocesses.** OpenCASCADE never returns freed memory to the OS, so
building all steps in one process is OOM-killed. `build_procedures` groups steps
by family in dependency order, runs each batch in its own subprocess, and
**retries crashed steps solo** (the hidden-line renderer intermittently
segfaults — re-running in a fresh process almost always succeeds).

**Naming convention.** Procedure and part files follow
`<family>_<NN>_<descriptor>.py`, where `NN` orders steps within a family in
gaps of 10. Families build in dependency order: `fastener → frame → idler →
motor → linear → belt → tapz → phone → board → camera → wire`.

## Prerequisites

- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — runs everything; resolves
  dependencies on demand.
- **`--group cad`** — pulls in build123d. Required for any script that touches
  geometry (parts, assemblies, BOM). The manual and sourcing builders are
  standard-library only and need no group.
- **Optional:** a Chromium-family browser for manual PDF export.

Run all commands **from the repo root**.

## Script usage

One entry point drives every stage. List the subcommands and their flags
with `--help`:

```bash
uv run --group cad python -m hardware --help
```

The subcommands — each forwarding its flags to the stage it wraps:

| subcommand | stage |
|---|---|
| `parts` | export part STEPs → `output/step/` |
| `build` | build assembly steps (STEP + SVG; `--bom` adds the BOM) |
| `step <stem>` | build one step via `build --bom --stems` (both variants) |
| `print` | 3D-print package → `output/print_3d/*.zip` |
| `manual` | bilingual HTML / PDF manual → `output/manual/` |
| `sourcing` | sourcing guide → `output/sourcing/` |
| `mark` / `replay` | annotate step SVGs / replay saved patches |
| `camera` | FreeCAD camera view → `Camera()` literal |

Geometry subcommands need `--group cad`; `manual` and `sourcing` are
standard-library only. Each stage module is also runnable on its own (e.g.
`uv run --group cad python -m hardware.parts.custom.solenoid_mount`).

For shorter typing, the repo `Makefile` wraps each subcommand as a `hw-*`
target (flags via `ARGS`):

```bash
make hw-parts                     # export part STEPs
make hw-build ARGS="--bom"        # build steps + cumulative BOM
make hw-step ARGS=belt_20_clamp   # build one step (= build --bom --stems)
make hw-print                     # 3D-print package (zip)
make hw-manual ARGS="--pdf"       # build manual, also as PDF
make hw-sourcing                  # build sourcing guide
make hw-mark ARGS=<svg|json>      # annotate a step drawing
pbpaste | make hw-camera          # FreeCAD view → Camera() literal
make hw-rebuild                   # full rebuild, all stages
make hw-help                      # list every subcommand
```

> **Photoreal render — WIP.** A separate Blender render of the full machine
> (`camera_40_frame`) is being reworked; its scripts were cleared and are not
> currently in the tree. The line-art SVG pipeline is unaffected.

## Typical full rebuild

```bash
uv run --group cad python -m hardware parts --custom --standard  # part STEPs
uv run --group cad python -m hardware build --bom                # steps + BOM
uv run --group cad python -m hardware print                      # 3D-print package
uv run            python -m hardware manual                      # the manual
uv run            python -m hardware sourcing                    # the sourcing guide
```
