"""Base class for assembly-step drawings.

``BaseAssembly`` inherits from ``BasePart`` — assemblies share the
build/export/output_path machinery (so ``.export()`` writes a STEP of
the composed assembly, handy for CAD inspection) and add ``.render()``
for the SVG drawing used in the manual.

Default filenames:
  * ``hardware/output/step/<module_name>_<variant>.step`` (inherited)
  * ``hardware/output/svg/<module_name>_<variant>_cam<i>.svg`` (this class)

    Two-layer SVG: if ``_build`` returns a Compound with top-level children

    separate SVG layers (ghost = lighter + phantom dashes) — exploded-view
    illustration of prep state vs result. Otherwise the whole assembly is

    Every assembly has two variants: ``exploded=True`` shows the install
    motion (gaps + ghosts), ``exploded=False`` shows the finished state.
    The flag is exposed as a ctor kwarg so callers can ``export()`` both
    from one ``__main__``, and so a downstream assembly can embed an
    upstream one in its assembled form (e.g. ``FR20SHCS(exploded=False)``).
    Output filenames are suffixed ``_exploded`` / ``_assembled`` to keep
    both on disk side by side, plus ``_cam<i>`` (always present, ``cam0``
