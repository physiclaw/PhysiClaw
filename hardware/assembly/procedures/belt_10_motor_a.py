"""Motor A belt on the assembled stage — extends linear_47_idler_rj2 by
routing the LEFT motor's GT2 belt across all of its pulleys and idlers.

The belt is one continuous strip, both ends clamped on the X-carriage
(modelled as 180° U-turns around 2 mm pins inside CLAMP_LEFT and
CLAMP_RIGHT). The full route, in path order:

    CLAMP_LEFT → PIN_LEFT (U-turn, r=2 mm)
        → LJ2     (X-gantry LEFT joint, lower idler — toothed)
        → LD      (front-LEFT corner idler)
        → LU.down2 (LU 1-idler stack)
        → MOTOR_A pulley
        → LU.down1 (LU 2-stack, BOTTOM idler)
        → RU.down2 (RU 1-idler stack)
        → RJ1     (X-gantry RIGHT joint, lower idler — smooth)
    → PIN_RIGHT (U-turn, r=2 mm) → CLAMP_RIGHT

Every waypoint sits at world Y = -42.75 (the lower belt plane), so the
belt centerline stays in a single XZ plane — no twist between motor
pulley and adjacent idlers. The motor pulley Y is set by the
LEFT_PULLEY_GAP constant in motor_30_pulley; coplanarity is part of
that assembly's calibration.

The base (linear_47_idler_rj2) is always shown assembled — the belt
itself has no exploded variant, since it's a single continuous strip
with no fasteners.
