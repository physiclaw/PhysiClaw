"""Belt clamp — standalone part show.

Renders the bare BeltClamp custom part on its own (no slider, no
belt, no screws), so the manual can show the clamp in isolation
before belt_20_clamp mounts it to the X-rail slider.

Unlike a mounting step there is no install motion, so the exploded
and assembled variants are identical — ``__main__`` renders only the
assembled one.

See belt_20_clamp for the part's placement on the slider.

Run from the repo root:

    uv run --group cad python -m hardware.assembly.procedures.belt_11_clamp_show
