"""Belt clamp on the X-rail slider — extends belt_10_motor_a by mounting
one BeltClamp part to the X-rail's MGN9H slider via four M3 × 8 BHCS
driven through the clamp's four mount holes (which form a 16 × 15 mm
grid matching the slider's M3 mount pattern).

Placement:
  * BeltClamp — oriented with native +X (length axis, also the mirror
    axis) along world +X (along the X-rail), native +Z (top face, where
    the screw heads bottom in the stadium-slot floors) outboard toward
    world -Y. The clamp's hole-grid center sits on the slider's M3
    mount-grid center; the bottom face lands flush on the slider top.
  * 4 × BHCS M3 × 8 — one per slot round-end. Underhead seats on the
    stadium-slot floor (slot_depth below the clamp top face); shank
    threads world +Y direction into the slider's M3 mount hole.

World position of the slider mount-grid center is derived from the
upstream assembly chain (no hardcoded numbers):
  * SLIDER_MOUNT_Y = -EXT_THICKNESS - 2·slider_top_z
    (slot face at -EXT_THICKNESS, joint bottom 10 mm inboard of that,
    1020 beam slot face there too, X-rail bottom on it, slider top
    one block-height further outboard).
  * SLIDER_MOUNT_Z = beam_center_world_z = LEFT joint big_csk world Z,
    available from the LI11Y / LI20Joint / LI31X chain.
  * SLIDER_MOUNT_X = 0 (LI32X has slider_position = 0.5 along a
    130 mm rail centered on world X = 0).

Two variants:
  * exploded — clamp pulled CLAMP_EXPLODE outboard along world -Y so
               the bracket-to-slider interface reads clearly; each
               BHCS shank-tip floats SCREW_EXPLODE further along the
               same axis (shared shank-tip line, motor_10_bracket
               convention).
  * assembled — clamp bottom flush on slider top, BHCS heads bottomed
                in the stadium-slot floors.

The base (belt_10_motor_a) is always shown assembled — the X-rail's
slider and the belt are already in place from that step.
