"""Motor B belt on the assembled stage — extends belt_20_clamp by
routing the RIGHT motor's GT2 belt across all of its pulleys and idlers.

Motor B's belt is the world-X mirror of motor A's belt plus a Y shift
down to the UPPER belt plane (Y = -51.75), so the two CoreXY belts
ride in distinct Y planes and don't interfere. See ``Belt`` in
hardware.parts.standard.belt for the mirror+shift convention and the
LJ2↔RJ2 / RJ1↔LJ1 / LU.down2↔RU.top1 / RU.down2↔LU.top1 mapping.

The base (belt_20_clamp) is always shown assembled — motor A's belt,
the X-rail slider, and the belt clamp are all already in place from
that step. Only motor B's belt has an exploded variant: lifted along
world -Y so its routing reads cleanly above the assembled stack.

Run from the repo root:

    uv run --group cad python -m hardware.assembly.procedures.belt_30_motor_b
