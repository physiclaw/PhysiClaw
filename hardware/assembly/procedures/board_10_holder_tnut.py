"""PCB-holder mounting hardware — sub-assembly of the PcbHolder with the FHCS +
hammer T-nut at each of its two rib mount holes.

The holder's underside rib carries two M5 countersink holes (20 mm apart),
recessed on the top (standoff) face. At each hole:

  * an FHCS M5 × 12 seats flush in the top recess and points DOWN — the conical
    head sits in the countersink, the shank passes down through the plate + rib
    and protrudes below the rib.
  * a hammer M5 T-nut sits below the rib, MOUTH UP (boss toward the rib) to
    receive the screw shank. In the next step this nut slides into the top slot
    of a 2040 extrusion and the screw clamps the holder down onto it.

Geometry in the PcbHolder native frame (plate in XY, z = 0 (bottom) → thickness
(top); rib protrudes -Z to z = -tab_thick; rib holes at (rib_cx ± pitch/2, rib_cy)).

Two variants:
  * exploded — screws lifted above the holder and nuts dropped below the rib,
               along the shared vertical (Z) install axis.
  * assembled — screws seated flush, nuts under the rib on the protruding shanks.
