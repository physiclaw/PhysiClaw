"""PCB holder mounted to the frame — sets the board_10 holder sub-assembly onto
the phone_40 frame, on the TOP short extrusion's outward side face, with the
holder's two rib hammer-nuts dropped one into each of the two 20 mm-pitch slots.

In phone_40 world the top short 2040 runs along X (X ∈ [-85, 85]) at Z ∈
[315, 335]; its 40 mm side faces are the ±Z faces, each carrying two slots at
Y = ±10 (pitch 20). board_10's rib holes are also 20 mm apart, so the two
hammer nuts land one in each slot.

board_10 is rotated +90° about Z so its rib (and the two nuts, 20 mm apart along
the rib) line up across the two slots at Y = ±10 with each nut's length along X
(the slot run); the PCB/standoff side keeps facing +Z, out of the frame's top
end. Then translated so the rib face seats on the +Z side face (Z = 335) and the
nuts straddle Y = 0.

Two variants:
  * exploded — the holder sub-assembly pulled out along +Z off the side face.
  * assembled — rib seated on the +Z side face, nuts in the two slots.
