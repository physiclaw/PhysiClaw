"""PCB on the holder — sets the MKS DLC32 board onto the board_20 holder and
fastens it through the four corners.

The PCB drops onto the holder's four standoffs (bottom face at z = thickness +
cyl_h, corner holes over the bores). Each corner is fastened with a BHCS M3 × 12
from the top — head on the PCB, shank down through the PCB + standoff + plate —
into an M3 square nut on the holder underside (seated in its locating recess).
Everything is built in the holder's native frame, then carried into the mounted
location by the same BOARD_PLACEMENT transform that positioned the holder.

Two variants:
  * exploded — PCB + screws lifted off the standoffs (screws floating above),
               nuts dropped below the plate, along the mount axis.
  * assembled — PCB seated, screws bottomed, nuts under the plate.
