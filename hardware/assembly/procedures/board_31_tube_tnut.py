"""Tube-holder mounting hardware — sub-assembly of the TubeHolder with the FHCS +
hammer T-nut at each of its two rib mount holes. The board_10 step for the PCB
holder, repeated for the tube holder.

The holder's underside rib carries two M5 countersink holes (``mount_hole_pitch``
apart, along Y), recessed on the top face. At each hole:

  * an FHCS M5 × 12 seats flush in the top recess and points DOWN — the conical
    head sits in the countersink, the shank passes down through the plate + rib
    and protrudes below the rib.
  * a hammer M5 T-nut sits below the rib, MOUTH UP (boss toward the rib) to
    receive the screw shank. In the next step (board_32) this nut drops into the
    top slot of the frame's 2040 and the screw clamps the holder down onto it.

Geometry in the TubeHolder native frame (plate in XY, z = 0 (bottom) → thickness
(top); rib protrudes -Z to z = -tab_thick; rib holes at (rib_cx, rib_cy ± pitch/2)).
The rib runs along Y — so the hammer nuts (length native +Z) are rotated to lie
along X (the slot run once board_32 seats the rib on the frame). board_32 carries
this whole sub-assembly to the frame by ``TUBE_HOLDER_PLACEMENT``.

Two variants:
  * exploded — screws lifted above the holder and nuts dropped below the rib,
               along the shared vertical (Z) install axis.
  * assembled — screws seated flush, nuts hanging loosely at the end of the
                protruding shanks (snugged to the rib only once bolted to the slot).
