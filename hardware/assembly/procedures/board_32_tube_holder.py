"""Tube holder mounted on the frame — sets the board_31 tube-holder sub-assembly
onto the top short 2040 (beside the control-board holder, on the -X side), with
the holder's two rib hammer-nuts dropped one into each of the two 20 mm-pitch
slots. The board_20 step for the PCB holder, repeated for the tube holder.

Extends board_30_pcb (the control board already in place). board_31's two nuts
are 20 mm apart along the rib (which runs along Y in the holder native frame);
the 180° about Z swings the socket boss to point along world -Y — which is
physically UP in the machine's use orientation — so the spigot stands up and the
tube drops into it. The holder is X-symmetric, so the nuts still drop into the
two slots at Y = ±10, and the translation seats the rib face on Z = SHORT_FACE_Z.

The TubeHolder's 4 mm socket anchors the fixed end of the PTFE stiffener tube;
the routed tube itself is added in the next step (board_40_teflon), which reads
``TUBE_HOLDER_PLACEMENT`` (exposed here) to route from the same placement.

Two variants:
  * exploded — the holder sub-assembly lifted off the frame along +Z.
  * assembled — rib seated on the +Z side face, nuts in the two slots.
