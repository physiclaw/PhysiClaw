"""Teflon-tube service route — anchors the OD4 PTFE stiffener tube from a frame-
mounted TubeHolder (near the control board) to the BeltClamp on the moving
carriage.

The solenoid wire is spiral-wrapped to the tube ALONGSIDE it (it does not pass
through the bore); the tube only stiffens the bundle. The route is an inverted-U
(∩): both sockets open upward, so the tube drops down into each (the TubeHolder
socket on the frame and the BeltClamp blind hole on the carriage) and arcs up
and over between them. Because the tube anchors to the frame and the carriage —
never to the control board — carriage motion no longer bends the PCB.

Both port poses are read out of the built assembly so the route stays correct if
upstream placement changes:
  * End A — the TubeHolder socket mouth (placed here on the top short 2040).
  * End B — the BeltClamp blind-hole mouth, carried by the clamp's global
    location within the assembly.

Two variants:
  * exploded — tube lifted off (+Z) to show it separated from the ports.
  * assembled — tube seated between the two ports.
