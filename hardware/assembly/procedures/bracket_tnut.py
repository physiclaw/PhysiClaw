"""Bracket fastening step — one flat bracket attached by 2 M5×10 BHCS
into 2 hammer T-nuts.

Two variants:

  * exploded — three part kinds stacked along the screw axis (world
               +Z): t-nuts at the bottom, bracket above with BRACKET_GAP
               of air, screws above with SCREW_GAP air below their
               shank tips. Order of operations reads top-down.
  * assembled — loose-mate state: each BHCS dropped through the
                bracket (underhead on the bracket top), with the t-nut
                hanging from the shank tip (boss top touches the tip).
                The bracket floats (BHCS_LENGTH − plate_thick) above
                the t-nut — visible threading clearance, screw not
                tightened.

  * 1 x FlatBracket (40 × 18 × 4 mm, two M5 through-holes 20 mm apart)
  * 2 x BHCS M5 × 10 — driven down through the bracket
  * 2 x TNut "hammer" M5 — catches the screw from below
