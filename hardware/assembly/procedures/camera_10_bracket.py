"""Camera mount (corner bracket) — an L-shaped CornerBracket fastened to a
frame extrusion through its horizontal face, carrying a 1/4-20 camera screw
on its vertical face.

  * Horizontal face (frame side, one centered hole): 1 x BHCS M5 x 10
    dropped from the top, catching a hammer M5 T-nut in the extrusion slot
    below (the extrusion isn't modelled here).
  * Vertical face (camera side, one centered hole): a SHCS 1/4-20 (the
    photographic-tripod thread) with a 1/4-20 hex nut on the far face. The
    screw axis is horizontal (along X); the nut clamps the 4 mm plate from
    the back.

Variants (same convention as idler_11_lu / frame_30_bracket_tnut):
  * exploded — horizontal stack opens along +Z (T-nuts on the floor,
    bracket lifted by BRACKET_GAP, BHCS shank tips floating SCREW_GAP above
    the deck); the camera screw and nut slide apart along their own ±X axis.
  * assembled — the bracket deck sits on the T-nut bosses, BHCS dropped
    through, and the camera screw + nut closed onto the vertical face.

Parts:
  * 1 x CornerBracket (26 mm bend, two 30 mm faces, 4 mm thick)
  * 1 x BHCS M5 x 10 + 1 x TNut "hammer" M5  (horizontal / frame side)
  * 1 x SHCS 1/4-20 x 16 + 1 x Nut "hex" 1/4-20  (vertical / camera side)
