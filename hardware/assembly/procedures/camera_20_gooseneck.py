"""Camera gooseneck — camera_10_bracket with a flexible gooseneck mounted on
its 1/4-20 screw.

Takes the corner-bracket sub-assembly from camera_10 (bracket + frame-side
BHCS/T-nuts + the 1/4-20 SHCS and hex nut) and threads a Gooseneck onto that
screw by its FEMALE 1/4-20 socket: the socket mouth opens toward the stud and
captures the thread exposed past the hex nut, then the neck arcs up to a free
male 1/4-20 stud (where a camera mounts in a later step).

Variants:
  * exploded — inherits camera_10's exploded layout; the gooseneck slides off
    the stud along −X (GOOSE_GAP) so the female socket reads as separate.
  * assembled — the female socket seated on the stud against the hex nut.

Parts (adds to camera_10_bracket):
  * 1 x Gooseneck (Ø10 neck, 1/4-20 male + female ends)

Run from the repo root:

    uv run --group cad python -m hardware.assembly.procedures.camera_20_gooseneck
