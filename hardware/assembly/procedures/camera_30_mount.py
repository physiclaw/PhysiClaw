"""Camera mount — camera_20_gooseneck with the Camera part clipped onto the
gooseneck's male 1/4-20 stud.

Takes the gooseneck sub-assembly from camera_20 (corner bracket + frame-side
fasteners + the 1/4-20 screw + gooseneck) and seats the Camera on the free end
of the gooseneck: the camera's front-face 1/4-20 FEMALE socket receives the
gooseneck's MALE stud, so the camera hangs off the neck tip.

Variants (the camera_20 gooseneck is always embedded assembled; only the
camera moves):
  * exploded — the camera slides off the stud along the mount axis
    (CAM_MOUNT_GAP).
  * assembled — the camera's socket seated against the stud's collar face.

Parts (adds to camera_20_gooseneck):
  * 1 x Camera (82 × 26 × 25 mm)
