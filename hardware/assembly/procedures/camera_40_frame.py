"""Camera on the frame — mounts the camera_30 arm onto board_40_teflon's RIGHT
long extrusion, on its outward (+X) side face.

In phone_40 / board_40 world the two long 2040s run along Z at X = ±105; the
right long's outward side face is its +X face (at X = 115). That 40 mm face
carries two T-slots at world Y = ±10 (running along Z). The corner bracket is
installed HORIZONTALLY — its two hammer T-nuts (30 mm apart) drop into the same
slot, spaced along Z — so the gooseneck arm reaches out over the phone bed and
the camera looks down at it.

Placement (CAMERA_PLACEMENT) maps the bracket's local frame onto the face:
  bracket +Z (deck outward normal) → world +X   (deck seats on the +X face)
  bracket +Y (the two-hole line)   → world +Z   (the two T-nuts run along the slot)
  bracket +X (deck depth)          → world +Y
The deck hole at bracket x = 15 lands on the chosen slot (world Y = SLOT_Y); the
two holes straddle MOUNT_Z, 30 mm apart along Z.

Two variants:
  * exploded — the camera arm pulled out along +X off the side face.
  * assembled — the bracket seated on the face, T-nuts in the slot.
