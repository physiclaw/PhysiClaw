"""Shim — fastener reference shape.

Renders a single M5 Ø8×0.5 shim washer on its own as a hardware
reference icon for the manual's HARDWARE — REFERENCE page (page 4).

An exhibit, not an install step — no install motion, so the exploded
and assembled variants are identical; ``__main__`` renders only the
assembled one (cf. belt_11_clamp_show).

Run from the repo root:

    uv run --group cad python -m hardware.assembly.procedures.fastener_40_shim
