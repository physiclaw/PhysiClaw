"""Hex driver — fastener reference shape.

Renders a single 2 mm L-shape hex driver (Allen key) on its own as a
hardware reference icon for the manual's HARDWARE — REFERENCE page
(page 4b). The 2 mm driver fits the M3 button- and flat-head sockets
and so sees the most use in the build.

An exhibit, not an install step — no install motion, so the exploded
and assembled variants are identical; ``__main__`` renders only the
assembled one (cf. belt_11_clamp_show).

Run from the repo root:

    uv run --group cad python -m hardware.assembly.procedures.fastener_50_hex_driver
