"""Extrusion + T-nut preload — slide standard T-nuts into 2040 slots.

The two variants use intentionally different layouts:

  * exploded — four extrusions stacked in Y rows.
      Solid:  extrusion + loose T-nuts queued past its +Z end, ready
              to slide in.
      Ghost:  destination silhouettes inside the slot — the seat
              positions the loose nuts will end up at.
      Each row's prep queue extends along its OWN +Z direction with no
      neighbor in the way; the install motion (slide along +Z into
      slot) reads cleanly per row. Row layout is intentional — easier
      to follow than a frame layout where prep queues from different
      members would collide.

  * assembled — the four members arranged as a rectangular frame:
                longs flush against shorts (separation=0), counterbore
                faces outboard, each long CB axis collinear with the
                matching short's end-cell bore. Nuts seated at their
                destinations; single layer.

  * 2 x 335 mm long extrusion (cb), each with 2 standard M5 T-nuts
    (top nut LONG_TOP_GAP from the frame top edge, bottom nut
    LONG_BOT_GAP from the frame bottom edge)
  * 1 x 170 mm short extrusion (top) with 4 standard M5 T-nuts
  * 1 x 170 mm short extrusion (bottom), plain
