"""Frame assembly step — 8 SHCS M6 close the four-member preload into
a rectangle. The preload itself (4 extrusions + seated T-nuts in the
populated members) comes from FR10ExtrusionTnut; this file just adds the
screws on top.

Two variants:

  * exploded — preload built with FR10ExtrusionTnut(separation=FRAME_GAP),
               so the longs sit FRAME_GAP outboard of the short ends
               (CB axes still collinear with the short end-cell bores).
               Screws floated further outboard along the entry axis at
               SCREW_EXPLODE.
  * assembled — preload built with FR10ExtrusionTnut(separation=0), longs
                flush against the short ends. Screws fully bottomed in
                the counterbores (position=cb_head_depth).
