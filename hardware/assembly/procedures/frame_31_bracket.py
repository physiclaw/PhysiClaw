"""Bracket-to-frame fastening — 4 flat brackets, one at each frame
corner, each spanning where a short extrusion meets a long. Fastened
by 2 BHCS M5 driven into 2 hammer T-nuts (one per slot) per bracket.
Reinforces the M6 SHCS end-tap joint already in place from frame_20_SHCS.

Composition:

  * Frame layer — FR20SHCS(exploded=False): 4 extrusions + 8 seated
    M6 SHCS + the preloaded standard T-nuts FR10ExtrusionTnut put inside
    the slots.
  * Bracket layer — one FR30BracketTnut sub-assembly per corner, oriented
    so its local +Z (the chain direction: t-nut → bracket → screw
    head) points outboard from the slot face (world -Y). Each
    FR30BracketTnut carries 1 bracket + 2 BHCS M5 + 2 hammer t-nuts.

Both variants use FR30BracketTnut(exploded=False) — the loose-mate
sub-assembly (BHCS dropped through bracket, t-nut hanging from shank
tip). Only the placement differs:

  * exploded  — chain pulled BRACKET_EXPLODE outboard of the slot face
                (t-nut floor sits in air, pre-install).
  * assembled — bracket BOTTOM flush on the slot face. The BHCS shank
                and t-nut reach inboard into the slot cavity.

The frame layer is always shown assembled — it's the prior step's
finished state that the brackets visibly reinforce.

Bracket-to-corner orientation: the bracket's two holes are along
FR30BracketTnut's local X axis. x_dir=(-sign_x, 0, 0) maps local -X (the
LEFT nut, whose slide axis runs along FR30BracketTnut's local Z direction)
onto the LONG-side hole at world ±half_w, and local +X (the RIGHT
nut, slide axis along FR30BracketTnut's local X) onto the SHORT-side hole
inboard from the corner. Slide-axis directions then fall out
correctly: long-side nut slides along world Z (the long's axis),
short-side nut slides along world X (the short's axis).
