"""Bumper fastening step — one cylindrical bumper attached by 1 M5×16
BHCS driven UP from below into 1 hammer T-nut catching the shank tip
above. Mirror of frame_30_bracket_tnut, but with the screw axis inverted: the
bumper's bottom-face cbore receives the head from below.

Two variants:

  * exploded — three part kinds stacked along the screw axis (world
               +Z): BHCS at the bottom (head down, shank up) with
               SCREW_GAP of air below the bumper bottom face; bumper
               in the middle with its cbore opening downward; T-nut
               above with TNUT_GAP between the bumper top and the
               boss top. Order of operations reads bottom-up.
  * assembled — loose-mate state, not yet fixed to the frame: BHCS
                head bottomed in the cbore (underhead at z = cbore_depth)
                and the t-nut hanging from the shank tip (boss top
                touches the tip), still floating above the bumper by
                the shank protrusion.

  * 1 x Bumper (Ø20 × 22 mm, Ø14 × 16 cbore on bottom, Ø5 through)
  * 1 x BHCS M5 × 16 — driven up from below
  * 1 x TNut "hammer" M5 — catches the shank tip from above (boss down)
