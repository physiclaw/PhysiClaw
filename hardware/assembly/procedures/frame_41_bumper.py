"""4 bumper feet at the frame corners — one per corner, on the +Y
face (opposite the brackets). Mirror of frame_31_bracket: same
composition pattern, opposite slot face.

Composition:

  * Frame layer — FR31Bracket(exploded=False): full frame + the four
    corner brackets reinforcing the SHCS M6 end-taps.
  * Bumper layer — one FR40BumperTnut sub-assembly per corner,
    sitting on the +Y slot face of the LONG extrusions near each
    end. The chain (BHCS head → bumper → t-nut) points world −Y
    into the slot; the t-nut slide axis (sub-asm +Y) maps to world
    +Z, tracking the long's length.

Both variants use FR40BumperTnut(exploded=False) — the loose-mate
state (head bottomed in cbore, t-nut hanging from shank tip). Only
the corner placement differs:

  * exploded — bumper top floats BUMPER_EXPLODE outboard of the +Y
               slot face; the t-nut floats with it.
  * assembled — bumper top flush on the +Y slot face; the t-nut hangs
                from the shank tip just inside the slot mouth.

The frame layer is always shown assembled — it's the prior step's
finished state that the bumpers visibly add feet to.

Camera mirrors frame_31_bracket's −30/25 about world Y so the +Y
face (where the bumpers live) is the one facing the camera.
