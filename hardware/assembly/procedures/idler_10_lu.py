"""Idler mount (left-up) — two shoulder-screw stacks of smooth idlers
and M5 thrust washers fastened into the PulleyMountMotor block's two
outer M4 through-holes (top face, at x = ±outer_hole_offset). M4
square nuts captured in the block's left/right side pockets engage
each shoulder screw's M4 thread.

Per stack: the 5 mm shoulder seats on the block's top face; the M4
thread reaches down into the 4.3 mm clearance hole and threads into
the captive square nut sitting in the side pocket (bore vertical,
aligned with the through-hole).

Stacks, in the user's top → bottom order:
  * LEFT (x = -outer_hole_offset), SHOULDER M4 × 20 mm
    idler (smooth) / ring M5×8×0.5 / idler (smooth) / ring M5×8×0.5
    Stack = 2 × 8.5 + 2 × 0.5 = 18 mm; shoulder 20 mm → 2 mm axial
    play so the idlers spin free.
  * RIGHT (x = +outer_hole_offset), SHOULDER M4 × 10 mm
    idler (smooth) / ring M5×8×0.5
    Stack = 8.5 + 0.5 = 9 mm; shoulder 10 mm → 1 mm play.

Each column also captures one M4 square nut in the block's side
pocket opening on the same side (LEFT nut in the -X-face pocket,
RIGHT nut in the +X-face pocket).

Two variants:
  * exploded — idler stacks laid out along +Z with EXPLODE_SEPARATION
               of air between adjacent parts. Both shoulder screws
               plus the center M5 BHCS share a single shank-tip line
               (SCREW_GAP above the taller stack) so all three tips
               align — heads sit at heights differing only by screw
               length. Same convention as motor_10_bracket. The two
               side-pocket M4 nuts pull outward by NUT_GAP along
               their ±X install axis; the top-pocket M5 nut lifts by
               TOP_NUT_LIFT along its +Z install axis (clear of the
               stack tops).
  * assembled — stacks tight on block top; side-pocket M4 nuts
                centered in their pockets, bores vertical and aligned
                with the shoulder-screw threads; center BHCS head
                bottomed in the cbore; top-pocket M5 nut bore aligned
                with the front-face M5 hole.

The center M5 counterbore takes a BHCS M5 × 10 that threads into a
hammer t-nut in the frame extrusion slot below (frame not modelled
here). The -Y face M5 hole receives a screw (not part of this
sub-assembly) that threads into the captive M5 square nut sitting in
the top -Y-edge pocket — the nut is added here so it ships pre-seated.
