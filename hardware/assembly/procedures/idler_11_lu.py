"""Idler-mount bracket (left-up) — flat bracket tying the IdlerMountMotor
lu block to a frame extrusion via two M5 BHCS. One screw catches a
hammer T-nut in the frame slot; the other threads into the captive M5
square nut that idler_10_lu already seated in the lu block's top pocket.

Hole pair (along bracket local X, 20 mm apart):
  * LEFT  — frame side: BHCS M5 × 10 + hammer T-nut M5 (captured in
            the frame extrusion slot, not modelled here). 10 mm is
            plenty: 4 bracket + 4.5 nut thread = 8.5, tip in open slot.
  * RIGHT — block side: BHCS M5 × 12, no nut in this sub-assembly —
            its mate is the captive top-pocket square nut from
            idler_10_lu. 12 mm is required: 4 bracket + 3.5 face-to-
            pocket standoff + 4 nut = 11.5; an M5×10 would engage only
            2.5 mm of the nut.

Both variants follow frame_30_bracket_tnut's bracket convention so
this reads as the "block-tying twin" of that step:

  * exploded — chain along world +Z: t-nut at the bottom (LEFT hole
               only), bracket above with BRACKET_GAP of air, both
               screws above with SCREW_GAP air below their shank tips.
               The RIGHT shank tip shares the LEFT's line; its head
               rides 2 mm higher (the RIGHT screw is 2 mm longer).
  * assembled — loose-mate: both BHCS dropped through the bracket
                (underheads on bracket top); the LEFT shank carries
                the t-nut hanging from its tip (boss top touching the
                tip, then slid up by TNUT_LIFT to read as
                "threaded most of the way in"). The RIGHT shank just
                protrudes — its mate lives on the block side.

  * 1 x FlatBracket (40 × 18 × 4 mm, two M5 through-holes 20 mm apart)
  * 1 x BHCS M5 × 10 — LEFT (frame-slot side), driven down through the bracket
  * 1 x BHCS M5 × 12 — RIGHT (block side), driven down through the bracket
  * 1 x TNut "hammer" M5 — LEFT hole only (frame-slot side)
