"""LU idler-mount + frame composition — combines frame_41_bumper (full
frame with corner brackets + bumper feet), idler_10_lu (the pulley-mount
block populated with idlers, shoulder screws and the captive top-pocket
M5 square nut), and idler_11_lu (the block-tying flat bracket).

Placement:

  * Frame layer — FR41Bumper(exploded=False) at world origin. Long
    extrusions run along world Z at x = ±half_w; long_left lives at
    x = -half_w (= -95 mm).
  * LU mount — ID10Lu(exploded=False) oriented so the block's 42 mm
    length axis (native +X) runs along world Z (the extrusion long
    direction), the 18 mm thickness (native +Z, top face) points
    world -Y (outboard, away from the slot), and the 20 mm width
    (native +Y) points world +X (toward the frame interior) — making
    the front face (native -Y) point world -X, i.e. outside the frame.
    The block is translated so its bottom face sits flush on
    long_left's slot_right face (world y = -EXT_THICKNESS) and its
    centerline lands on the TOP standard M5 T-nut of long_left at
    world z = LONG_LENGTH - LONG_TOP_GAP. The center M5 BHCS in the
    lu block engages that t-nut.
  * Block-tying bracket — ID11Lu(exploded=False) oriented so its BHCS
    shanks point world +X (into the lu block's front-face M5 hole at
    world x = -105). The bracket lies flat against the world -X face
    (in the Y-Z plane), with its 20 mm hole spacing along world Y:
    RIGHT hole at the lu front-face hole world y reaches the captive
    square nut in the block's top pocket via the front-face clearance
    hole; LEFT hole, 20 mm away in +Y, sits over a t-nut in the
    extrusion's -X-face slot (the slot at local +Y of the cell at
    local x = +cell_offset, mapped to world y = -10). The 20 mm
    bracket hole spacing matches the front-face-to-slot Y gap exactly
    in assembled mode (front face at world y = -30, slot at -10).

Two variants:
  * exploded — lu mount pulled outboard along world -Y; bracket
               follows the block in Y (preserving the front-face hole
               interface) and is additionally pulled outward along
               world -X by BRACKET_EXPLODE so the bracket-to-block
               interface reads clearly. The LEFT-hole-to-slot mate is
               only meaningful in assembled mode.
  * assembled — lu mount flush on the long's slot face, bracket flush
                against the block's front face / extrusion -X face.

The frame layer is always shown assembled — it's the prior step's
finished state that this composition builds onto.
