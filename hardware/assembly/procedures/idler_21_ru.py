"""Idler-mount bracket (right-up) — geometrically identical to
idler_11_lu (1 flat bracket + 2 M5×10 BHCS + 1 hammer M5 T-nut on the
LEFT hole). The two files exist as separate sub-assemblies so each can
be placed independently at its own corner of the frame; the build
logic lives in idler_11_lu and is reused here via inheritance, with
just the Compound label retargeted so the STEP / SVG outputs land at
``idler_21_ru_*`` instead of ``idler_11_lu_*``.

See idler_11_lu for the full part list, variant descriptions, and
placement math.

Run from the repo root:

    uv run --group cad python -m hardware.assembly.procedures.idler_21_ru
