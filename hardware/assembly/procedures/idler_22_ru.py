"""RU idler-mount + frame composition — extends idler_12_lu (frame +
LU mount + LU bracket) by adding the right-up counterparts: idler_20_ru
(the pulley-mount block populated with idlers, shoulder screws and the
captive top-pocket M5 square nut) and idler_21_ru (the block-tying flat
bracket).

The RU mount is the mirror of LU across the world YZ plane: same
outboard-Y placement, but on the right long extrusion. The block's
42 mm length still runs along world Z (extrusion long direction); the
front face (native -Y) points world +X — i.e. outside the frame on the
right side — and the 20 mm width (native +Y) points world -X (toward
the frame interior).

Placement:

  * Base layer — ID12Lu(exploded=False) at world origin. This already
    bundles the full frame, the LU mount on long_left, and the LU
    block-tying bracket. Long extrusions run along world Z at
    x = ±half_w; long_right lives at x = +half_w (= +95 mm).
  * RU mount — ID20Ru(exploded=False) oriented so the block's 42 mm
    length axis (native +X) runs along world Z (the extrusion long
    direction), the 18 mm thickness (native +Z, top face) points
    world -Y (outboard, away from the slot), and the 20 mm width
    (native +Y) points world -X (toward the frame interior) — making
    the front face (native -Y) point world +X, i.e. outside the
    frame. The block is translated so its bottom face sits flush on
    long_right's slot_right face (world y = -EXT_THICKNESS) and its
    centerline lands on the TOP standard M5 T-nut of long_right at
    world z = LONG_LENGTH - LONG_TOP_GAP. The center M5 BHCS in the
    ru block engages that t-nut.
  * Block-tying bracket — ID21Ru(exploded=False) oriented so its BHCS
    shanks point world -X (into the ru block's front-face M5 hole at
    world x = +105). The bracket lies flat against the world +X face
    (in the Y-Z plane), with its 20 mm hole spacing along world Y:
    RIGHT hole at the ru front-face hole world y reaches the captive
    square nut in the block's top pocket via the front-face clearance
    hole; LEFT hole, 20 mm away in +Y, sits over a t-nut in the
    extrusion's +X-face slot (the slot at local +Y of the cell at
    local x = +cell_offset, mapped to world y = -10). The 20 mm
    bracket hole spacing matches the front-face-to-slot Y gap exactly
    in assembled mode (front face at world y = -30, slot at -10).

Two variants:
  * exploded — ru mount pulled outboard along world -Y; bracket
               follows the block in Y (preserving the front-face hole
               interface) and is additionally pulled outward along
               world +X by BRACKET_EXPLODE so the bracket-to-block
               interface reads clearly. The LEFT-hole-to-slot mate is
               only meaningful in assembled mode.
  * assembled — ru mount flush on the long's slot face, bracket flush
                against the block's front face / extrusion +X face.

The base ID12Lu layer is always shown assembled — it's the prior
step's finished state that this composition builds onto.
