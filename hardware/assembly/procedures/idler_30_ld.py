"""Idler mount (left-down) — single smooth idler held to a
PulleyMountFront block by a 10 mm M4 shoulder screw through the
block's top-face M4 hole (at world x = 0, y = top_hole_y, on the
+Y-half of the top face). The 5 mm shoulder seats on the block top;
the M4 thread reaches down into the 4.3 mm clearance hole and threads
into the captive M4 square nut sitting in the +Y-face back pocket
(bore vertical, aligned with the through-hole).

Stack, in the user's top → bottom order:
  idler (smooth) / ring M5×8×0.5
  Stack = 8.5 + 0.5 = 9 mm; shoulder 10 mm → 1 mm axial play so the
  idler spins free.

Two variants:
  * exploded — stack laid out along +Z with EXPLODE_SEPARATION of air
               between adjacent parts. The M4 shoulder screw's thread
               tip floats SCREW_GAP above the stack top (same shank-tip
               convention as idler_10_lu / motor_10_bracket). The
               frame-mount M5 BHCS, sitting on the opposite -Y half of
               the top face at world y = slot_center_y, floats BHCS_GAP
               above the block top face — it has no stack to clear, so
               its shank-tip line sits lower than the shoulder's. The
               M4 square nut pulls outward NUT_GAP along +Y, the
               back-face install axis.
  * assembled — stack tight on block top; M4 nut bore vertical,
                centered in the back pocket and aligned with the
                shoulder thread; M5 BHCS head bottomed on the
                stadium-slot floor.

The block's stadium slot (with its M5 through-hole) is the
frame-mount interface — its BHCS M5 × 10 threads into a hammer t-nut
in the frame extrusion slot below (frame not modelled here).
