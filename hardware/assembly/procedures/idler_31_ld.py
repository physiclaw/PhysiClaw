"""LD idler-mount + frame composition — extends idler_22_ru (frame +
LU mount + RU mount + their brackets) by adding the left-down
counterpart: idler_30_ld (single-idler PulleyMountFront block populated
with idler, ring, shoulder screw, captive M4 nut, and frame-mount
M5 BHCS).

The LD block (20 × 20 × 18) mounts onto long_left's slot face at the
BOTTOM t-nut. Unlike the LU/RU PulleyMountMotor blocks, the M5 BHCS in
the PulleyMountFront block is OFF-CENTER (at native y = slot_center_y
= -6) — pinning the BHCS to the t-nut forces the block to extend
asymmetrically in world Z. The chosen orientation puts the back face
(native +Y, with the captive M4 nut pocket) toward world +Z (the frame
top), so the block extends from the t-nut upward into the frame body
rather than off the bottom edge.

Placement:

  * Base layer — ID22Ru(exploded=False) at world origin. Bundles the
    full frame plus both upper mounts and their brackets. Long
    extrusions run along world Z at x = ±half_w; long_left lives at
    x = -half_w (= -95 mm).
  * LD mount — ID30Ld(exploded=False) oriented so the block's 18 mm
    thickness (native +Z, top face) points world -Y (outboard, away
    from the slot), the 20 mm native X axis runs along world X (the
    extrusion's narrow direction), and the 20 mm native Y axis runs
    along world Z. With the BHCS at native y = slot_center_y = -6 the
    block centerline lands LONG_BOT_GAP - slot_center_y above the
    frame's bottom edge, so the block extends upward from the t-nut
    in world Z. The block is translated so its bottom face sits flush
    on long_left's slot_right face (world y = -EXT_THICKNESS) and its
    M5 BHCS shank exits at world (x = -half_w, y = -EXT_THICKNESS,
    z = LONG_BOT_GAP) — threading into long_left's bottom standard
    M5 T-nut.

Two variants:
  * exploded — ld mount pulled outboard along world -Y by LD_EXPLODE
               so the BHCS install path reads clearly.
  * assembled — ld mount flush on the long's slot face.

The base ID22Ru layer is always shown assembled — it's the prior
step's finished state that this composition builds onto.
