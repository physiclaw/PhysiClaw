"""RD idler-mount + frame composition — extends idler_31_ld (frame +
LU/RU mounts + their brackets + LD mount) by adding the right-down
counterpart: idler_40_rd (single-idler PulleyMountFront block with the
spacer + washer + idler stack on a 20 mm M4 shoulder screw).

The RD block (20 × 20 × 18) mounts onto long_right's slot face at the
BOTTOM t-nut. Uses the same orientation as LD — the PulleyMountFront
block is symmetric across its own YZ plane and has no front-face
feature requiring a chiral flip, so mirroring to the right side only
changes the world X position (-half_w → +half_w).

Placement:

  * Base layer — ID31Ld(exploded=False) at world origin. Bundles the
    full frame plus both upper mounts and their brackets, and the
    left-down mount. Long extrusions run along world Z at
    x = ±half_w; long_right lives at x = +half_w (= +95 mm).
  * RD mount — ID40Rd(exploded=False) oriented the same way as LD:
    native +X → world +X, native +Z (top face) → world -Y (outboard),
    derived native +Y → world +Z (back face / captive-nut side toward
    the frame top). The block is translated so its bottom face sits
    flush on long_right's slot_right face (world y = -EXT_THICKNESS)
    and its M5 BHCS shank exits at world (x = +half_w,
    y = -EXT_THICKNESS, z = LONG_BOT_GAP) — threading into
    long_right's bottom standard M5 T-nut.

Two variants:
  * exploded — rd mount pulled outboard along world -Y by RD_EXPLODE
               so the BHCS install path reads clearly.
  * assembled — rd mount flush on the long's slot face.

The base ID31Ld layer is always shown assembled — it's the prior
step's finished state that this composition builds onto.
