"""Linear Y rail sub-assembly — one MGN9H 220 mm guideway with six
M3 × 10 FHCS in the rail's mounting holes and six M3 hammer T-nuts
ready to engage them.

Hole layout (11 holes at 20 mm pitch on a 220 mm rail):
  Screws at every odd 1-indexed hole position — 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 —
  i.e. one screw every other hole (40 mm pitch), with both ends
  included.

Geometry in the rail's native frame (matches MGN9H — rail bottom
face at native Z = 0, length axis along native X):
  * Each FHCS sits with its head top flush with the rail top face
    (native Z = rail_height); its shank passes through the rail body
    and protrudes into the slot mouth where the hammer T-nut catches
    it.
  * Each hammer T-nut HANGS LOOSELY from its screw's shank tip —
    only TNUT_LOOSE_ENGAGEMENT mm of the shank is inside the bore.
    This is the pre-install state: the bundle (rail + screws +
    t-nuts) is ready to be pressed onto an extrusion slot. Final
    tightening on the slot pulls each t-nut up the shank until the
    plate top catches the slot lip (1.8 mm inside the slot face,
    derived from leg - slot_lip_under_y) — not modeled here.
  * The t-nut's placement plane maps its native +Y (plate depth /
    bore axis) → rail +Z so the bore aligns with the screw shank,
    and native +Z (slot length) → rail +X.

Two variants:
  * exploded — screws lifted SCREW_EXPLODE above the rail top face;
               t-nuts dropped TNUT_EXPLODE below their loose-hang
               position. Reads as "fasteners ready to assemble onto
               the rail."
  * assembled — screws seated in the rail with t-nuts hanging
                loosely from each shank tip.
