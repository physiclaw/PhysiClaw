"""Linear Y rails on the frame — extends motor_30_pulley (frame +
4 corner idlers + both motors + pulleys) by mounting two LI10Y rail
sub-assemblies on the long extrusions' slot faces, one on long_left
and one on long_right.

Each LI10Y already bundles its own MGN9H + 6 M3 × 10 FHCS + 6 hammer
M3 T-nuts (built in the rail's native frame). This step just places
each instance onto the corresponding extrusion:

  * The rail is centered in the free world-Z range between the two
    corner-mount blocks on each long extrusion — LU/RU
    (PulleyMountMotor, 42 mm length) at the top and LD/RD
    (PulleyMountFront, 20 mm width) at the bottom. Centering on
    LONG_LENGTH/2 would put the rail top past the LU/RU block bottom
    and clash with it; the midpoint of [LD top, LU bottom] sits the
    rail cleanly between them.
  * Origin at (±half_w, slot_face_y, rail_center_z), rail bottom
    face flush on the slot_right face.
  * Rail native +X (length) → world +Z (along the long).
  * Rail native +Z (rail top) → world -Y (outboard, away from the
    slot face).

Two variants:
  * exploded — both rails pulled outboard along world -Y by
               RAIL_EXPLODE so the install path reads clearly.
  * assembled — rail bottom flush on the slot face.

The base (motor_30_pulley) is always shown assembled.
