"""Linear X crossbeam — sub-assembly with one 165 mm Extrusion1020
and two standard M5 T-nuts pre-loaded in its slot at the positions
where linear_31_x's joint screws will engage them.

Geometry in the 1020's native frame (matches Extrusion1020 — slot
face at native Y = 9.9, length along native Z = 0 to length):
  * T-nut native Z (length) → 1020 native Z; bore axis = native Y.
  * Wings (t-nut native Y = engagement_y = 3.3) catch the 1020
    cavity ceiling at native Y = 8 (the bottom of the narrow slot
    wall, where the 9 mm wings stop as they're pulled up against
    the slot).
  * Two t-nuts: centers at native Z = TNUT_POSITIONS, derived so
    each bore lands directly under the corresponding joint big-CSK
    hole when the sub-assembly is placed centered on world X = 0
    in linear_31_x. SCREW_SPACING (= 2 × big-CSK distance from
    frame centerline) is derived from frame width + XyJoint
    hole-grid offset + big-CSK offset in the joint native frame.

Two variants:
  * exploded — each t-nut slid TNUT_EXPLODE further along the slot
               toward the nearest open end of the 1020, reading as
               "inserted from this end and slid into position."
  * assembled — t-nuts at their final positions, wings against the
                cavity ceiling.
