"""Linear X crossbeam on the frame — extends linear_20_joint by
mounting linear_30_x (an Extrusion1020 sub-assembly with two
standard M5 T-nuts pre-loaded in its slot) between the two XY
joints, then driving an M5 × 12 FHCS through each joint's big CSK
hole into the corresponding pre-loaded t-nut.

The t-nut positions are computed inside linear_30_x so that when
the sub-assembly is placed here (centered on world X = 0), each
t-nut's bore lands exactly at the joint's big-CSK world X.

Placement:
  * linear_30_x sub-assembly: centered on world X = 0, slot face
    flush against the joints' bottom faces at world Y = -30. Native
    +X (cross-section) → world +Z; native +Y (slot face) → world
    -Y; native +Z (length) → world +X.
  * Each FHCS placed at its joint's big-CSK world position, head
    flush with the joint top face; shank passes through the joint
    into the t-nut.

Two variants:
  * exploded — separation along the actual install axis (world Y):
               the linear_30_x sub-assembly (1020 + its t-nuts)
               shifts deeper into the frame along world +Y by
               X_BEAM_EXPLODE; each FHCS lifts outward along world
               -Y by FHCS_EXPLODE. Reads as "1020 mates from one
               side of the joint, screws drop in from the other".
  * assembled — 1020 against joint bottoms, t-nuts inside its slot,
                FHCS heads flush with the joint top face.

The base (linear_20_joint) is always shown assembled.
