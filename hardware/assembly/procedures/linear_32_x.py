"""Linear X rail sub-assembly (short) — MGN9H 150 mm guideway with
M3 × 10 FHCS in the rail's mounting holes and hammer M3 T-nuts
hanging loosely from each shank tip, ready to engage.

Same construction as linear_10_y (LI10Y) — only the rail length,
screw-hole pattern, and slider position differ. The build logic is
reused via inheritance; this class just overrides four class
attributes.

Hole layout (7 holes at 20 mm pitch on a 150 mm rail):
  Screws at 1-indexed hole positions 1, 3, 5, 7 — every other hole
  (40 mm pitch), both ends included. 4 screws total.

Slider position:
  slider_position = 0.5 puts the slider centered along the rail
  (= world X = 0 after LI33X places the rail centered on world X = 0),
  matching the X-axis carriage's natural home position.

See linear_10_y for the full part list, geometry derivation, and
variant descriptions.
