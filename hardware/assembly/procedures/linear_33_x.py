"""Linear X rail on the crossbeam — extends linear_31_x by mounting
the linear_32_x sub-assembly (130 mm MGN9H rail + 4 M3 × 10 FHCS +
4 hammer M3 T-nuts, hanging loosely from the screw shanks) onto
the 1020 crossbeam's slot.

The rail runs along world X (= 1020 length axis), centered on the
1020 (world X = 0). Rail bottom flush against the 1020's slot face
at world Y = beam_slot_face (= -30 in the current frame, exposed
by linear_31_x as a hook). Cross-section centered on world Z =
beam_center (= 187.5).

Joint orientation:
  * native +X (rail length) → world +X.
  * native +Z (rail top)    → world -Y (outboard, in front of 1020).
  * native +Y (rail width)  → world +Z (derived).

Two variants:
  * exploded — the rail (with its loose-hanging fasteners) lifted
               along world -Y by RAIL_EXPLODE, reading "rail
               pressed onto the 1020 slot from this direction".
  * assembled — rail bottom flush on the 1020 slot face.

The base (linear_31_x) is always shown assembled.
