"""Linear-stage idler bundle (LJ1) — a shoulder-screw axle carrying
an idler (toothed or smooth) over an M5×8×0.5 washer, optionally
with an M5×10×9 spacer beneath the washer, ready to bolt into the
host's tapped M4 hole (host not modelled here).

Subclasses share this build logic and override these class attributes:
  * ``compound_label``  retargets the embedded compound label (and
                        the STEP / SVG filename via ``_module_stem``).
  * ``toothed``         picks toothed (belt-tracking) vs smooth
                        (low-friction) idler.
  * ``include_spacer``  adds an M5×10×9 spacer at the bottom of the
                        stack — needed when the idler must sit
                        higher off the host top.
  * ``shoulder_len``    SHOULDER M4 length; pick to match the
                        resulting stack height + a couple of mm of
                        free-shoulder play above the thread so the
                        idler spins free.

Stack composition (assembled, install face at native Z = 0, stack
growing up along +Z):
  * (optional) spacer (M5×10×9, 9 mm)        install face at z = 0
  * washer            (M5×8×0.5, 0.5 mm)     above the spacer
  * idler             (flange_belt_h = 8.5 mm)  above the washer
  * SHOULDER M4 × shoulder_len screw         underhead seated on the
                                              idler top

Stack heights and matching shoulder lengths:
  * with spacer    — 9 + 0.5 + 8.5 = 18 mm; shoulder 20 mm → 2 mm play
  * without spacer —     0.5 + 8.5 =  9 mm; shoulder 10 mm → 1 mm play
The M4 thread (7.2 mm) protrudes below the install face into the
host's tapped hole.

Two variants:
  * exploded — stack laid out along +Z with EXPLODE_SEPARATION of air
               between adjacent parts (bottom part fixed at z = 0);
               screw lifted so its thread tip sits SCREW_GAP above
               the idler's exploded top face.
  * assembled — stack tight, screw underhead touching the idler top,
                free shoulder above the thread, thread protruding
                below z = 0.
