"""Left-joint idler (LJ1) on the assembled X stage — extends
linear_33_x by mounting one linear_40_idler_lj1 bundle on the LEFT
XY joint's extra_hole (with the front pocket beneath it), plus an
M4 square nut captured in that pocket to receive the bundle's
shoulder-bolt thread.

The bundle's install face (stack bottom) lands on the joint top
face, centered on extra_hole; the shoulder rod sits OUTBOARD along
world -Y; the M4 thread passes down through the joint's M4 clearance
hole and engages the captured nut. The pocket opens at the joint's
native -Y face which, after the joint placement, faces world +Z —
so the nut is dropped in from above.

Placement (read from the LI20Joint feature hooks forwarded through
LI31X / LI33X — no joint math repeated here):
  * Bundle origin = joint extra_hole world center (the joint-top
    point where the bundle's install face sits). Bundle native +Z →
    world -Y (outboard).
  * Nut center = joint front-pocket world center. Nut native +Z
    (bore + chamfer) → world +Y, so the FLAT full-square face lands
    outboard (world -Y, the camera-facing side of the joint) and the
    chamfered face faces inboard. Origin Y is shifted by half the
    nut thickness so the nut centers in the pocket along world Y.

Two variants:
  * exploded — bundle lifted along world -Y by BUNDLE_EXPLODE (the
               install direction the bundle came from); nut lifted
               along world +Z by NUT_EXPLODE (the pocket-opening
               direction the nut slides through). The bundle itself
               is shown assembled — its own fastener-explode reading
               belongs to linear_40_idler_lj1.
  * assembled — bundle install face flush on joint top, nut seated
                in the pocket, shoulder thread engaging the nut.

The base (linear_33_x) is always shown assembled.
