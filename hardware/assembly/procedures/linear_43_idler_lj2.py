"""Left-joint idler (LJ2) on the assembled X stage — extends
linear_41_idler_lj1 by mounting one linear_42_idler_lj2 bundle on
the LEFT XY joint's second M4 hole (extra_hole2, near the slant
cutout), plus an M4 square nut captured in the SLANT ("side") pocket
to receive the bundle's shoulder-bolt thread.

The bundle's install face lands on the joint top, centered on
extra_hole2; the shoulder rod sits OUTBOARD along world -Y (same
orientation as the LJ1 bundle). The M4 thread passes down through
extra_hole2 and engages the nut in the slant pocket. The slant
pocket opens on the joint's slant face, so the nut slides in along
the slant face outward normal — a world XZ-diagonal direction
specific to the LEFT joint.

Placement (read from the LI20Joint feature hooks forwarded through
LI31X / LI33X / LI41IdlerLj1 — no joint math repeated here):
  * Bundle origin = joint extra_hole2 world center. Bundle native +Z
    → world -Y (outboard).
  * Nut center XZ = bolt XZ (so the bolt thread passes through the
    bore center); nut center Y = slant_pocket Y - thickness/2 (so the
    nut centers in the pocket along the bore axis). Nut native +X
    aligns with the slant edge in world; nut native +Z (bore +
    chamfer) → world +Y, so the FLAT face lands outboard (world -Y,
    camera-facing) and the chamfered face faces inboard, matching
    the LJ1 nut convention.

Two variants:
  * exploded — bundle lifted along world -Y by BUNDLE_EXPLODE; nut
               shifted along the slant face outward normal by
               NUT_EXPLODE (the direction it slides into the pocket
               from). The bundle itself is shown assembled — its own
               fastener-explode reading belongs to linear_42_idler_lj2.
  * assembled — bundle install face flush on joint top, nut seated in
                the slant pocket, shoulder thread engaging the nut.

The base (linear_41_idler_lj1) is always shown assembled.
