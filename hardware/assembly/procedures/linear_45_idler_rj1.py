"""Right-joint idler (RJ1) on the assembled X stage — extends
linear_43_idler_lj2 by mounting one linear_44_idler_rj1 bundle on
the RIGHT XY joint's extra_hole (with the front pocket beneath it),
plus an M4 square nut captured in that pocket to receive the
bundle's shoulder-bolt thread.

This mirrors linear_41_idler_lj1 to the RIGHT joint: same hole +
pocket pair (extra_hole + front_pocket), same outboard install
direction (world -Y), same nut convention (flat face outboard /
camera-facing, chamfered face inboard). On the right joint,
extra_hole lands at the +X-side of the joint — toward the right Y
extrusion. The bundle itself differs (linear_44_idler_rj1 = smooth
idler, no spacer, 10 mm shoulder), but the joint-mount geometry is
identical to LJ1.

Placement (read from the LI20Joint feature hooks forwarded through
LI31X / LI33X / LI41IdlerLj1 / LI43IdlerLj2 — no joint math repeated
here):
  * Bundle origin = RIGHT joint extra_hole world center. Bundle native
    +Z → world -Y (outboard).
  * Nut center = RIGHT joint front_pocket world center. Nut native +Z
    (bore + chamfer) → world +Y. Origin Y shifted by -thickness/2 so
    the nut centers in the pocket along the bore axis.

Two variants:
  * exploded — bundle lifted along world -Y by BUNDLE_EXPLODE; nut
               lifted along world +Z by NUT_EXPLODE (the pocket
               opening direction). The bundle itself is shown
               assembled — its own fastener-explode reading belongs
               to linear_44_idler_rj1.
  * assembled — bundle install face flush on joint top, nut seated in
                the pocket, shoulder thread engaging the nut.

The base (linear_43_idler_lj2) is always shown assembled.
