"""Motor + bracket fastening — motor bracket plate attached to a
NEMA 17 motor via 4 BHCS M3 in the motor's top-face threaded
mounts, plus 2 BHCS M5 and 2 ring spacers that form the bracket's
frame-mount interface on the +X side.

Two variants:

  * exploded — motor at the bottom, bracket above with BRACKET_GAP
               of air, all 6 screws above with SCREW_GAP air below
               their shank tips (shared shank-tip line, so M5 heads
               sit higher than M3 heads by their length difference).
               Rings hang from the bracket bottom — they're a
               bracket-side feature, travelling with the bracket.
  * assembled — finished state: bracket bottom flush on the motor's
                top body face, 4 BHCS M3 dropped through the bracket
                into the motor's M3 mounts; 2 BHCS M5 dropped through
                the bracket and the ring spacers, ready to thread
                into a frame hammer t-nut (frame not modelled here).

The bracket's 25 mm shaft pass-through sits at bracket-local
X = -10 mm. To centre the pass-through over the motor shaft (at
world 0, 0), the bracket is translated +10 mm along world X. The
four M3 holes then land at world (±half_pitch, ±half_pitch),
directly over the motor's M3 mounts; the two M5 holes land at
world (+32, ±12.5), well clear of the motor body — that's where
the rings hang and the M5 screws drop through.

  * 1 x Nema17Motor
  * 1 x MotorBracket
  * 4 x BHCS M3 × 6 — into the motor's top-face M3 mounts
  * 2 x BHCS M5 × 16 — through the bracket and ring spacer
  * 2 x Ring M6 × 12 × 8 — spacer between bracket and frame
