"""Motor + bracket on the frame (left motor) — extends idler_41_rd
(frame + 4 corner idler mounts + their brackets) by adding
motor_10_bracket (NEMA 17 motor with bracket plate + ring spacers +
4 M3 + 2 M5 BHCS) onto the LEFT TWO standard M5 T-nuts on short_top.

The two M5 BHCS span 25 mm along the bracket's native Y axis, which
matches the 25 mm spacing between short_top's outermost left t-nut
(at local Z = SHORT_TOP_END_GAP) and its inner-left neighbour
(at SHORT_TOP_END_GAP + SHORT_TOP_INNER_GAP) — so pinning the screws
to that pair fully determines the bracket's X position.

Orientation:
  * native +Z (bracket / screw-head side) → world -Y (in front of the
    frame, where the heads are accessible). The M5 shanks (native -Z)
    therefore point world +Y, into the slot and into the t-nut bores.
  * native +X (bracket extends out from the motor body) → world +Z
    (down into the frame interior), so the bracket's M5 holes — at
    native x = m5_native_x past the motor body — land on short_top
    one ring-height in front of its slot face, while the motor body
    itself drops INSIDE the frame rectangle (world z < short_top
    centerline).
  * derived native +Y (M5-pair direction) → world -X, so the two M5
    screws land 25 mm apart in world X along short_top's length.

Placement:

  * Base layer — ID41Rd(exploded=False) at world origin. Bundles the
    full frame + 4 corner idler mounts + their brackets.
  * Motor bracket — MO10Bracket(exploded=False) translated so its two
    M5 BHCS shanks land at the LEFT TWO short_top t-nuts (world x =
    -SHORT_LENGTH/2 + SHORT_TOP_END_GAP and
    -SHORT_LENGTH/2 + SHORT_TOP_END_GAP + SHORT_TOP_INNER_GAP, both at
    world z = LONG_LENGTH - cb_end_offset). The bracket bottom sits
    one ring-height in front of the slot face (world y =
    -EXT_THICKNESS - ring_height); the rings span the gap to the
    slot face at world y = -EXT_THICKNESS.

Two variants:
  * exploded — motor assembly pulled outboard along world -Y by
               MOTOR_EXPLODE so the BHCS install path reads clearly.
  * assembled — rings flush against the slot face.

The base ID41Rd layer is always shown assembled — it's the prior
step's finished state that this composition builds onto.
