"""Motor + bracket fastening (right motor) — built like motor_10_bracket
but with ``motor_z_rotation = 0`` so the motor is NOT spun 180° about Z.
The cable-connector face therefore stays on native -Y, which lands on
world +X (RIGHT side from the top view) when the bracket is composed onto
a frame's right motor mount (mirror of motor_11_frame). The shaft's D-cut
flat stays on native +Y as well. This bracket uses a single 12 mm spacer
(``RING_SPEC = "M6x12x12"``) for a 12 mm standoff, so Motor B's pulley lands
on the UPPER belt plane (Motor A uses an 8 mm spacer for the lower plane),
plus the matching longer ``BHCS_M5_LENGTH = 20`` screw that spans it.

The build logic lives in motor_10_bracket and is reused here via
inheritance, with just ``compound_label``, ``RING_SPEC``,
``BHCS_M5_LENGTH``, and ``motor_z_rotation`` retargeted. See
motor_10_bracket for the full part list, variant descriptions, and
placement math.
