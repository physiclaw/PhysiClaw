"""Motor pulleys — extends motor_21_frame (frame + 4 corner idlers +
both motors with brackets) by placing one GT2 20-tooth pulley on each
motor's shaft.

Pulley placement reads the ``pulley_plane`` hooks exposed by MO11Frame
(left motor) and MO21Frame (right motor) — each plane already encodes
the world position of the bracket-top seat (= motor pilot-pad top
face), the shaft axis (world -Y), and a rotation aligning the
pulley's native +Y set-screw with the motor's D-flat (world +X for
the left motor, world -X for the right). That keeps this composition
free of any motor-placement math.

Each pulley sits some distance above the pad top face along the
shaft — the gap differs per side so the two belt runs end up at
distinct heights and don't share a plane:

  * LEFT  — LEFT_PULLEY_GAP mm above the pad top
  * RIGHT — RIGHT_PULLEY_GAP mm above the pad top

Two variants:
  * exploded — pulleys pulled outboard along world -Y (the shaft
               axis) by PULLEY_EXPLODE so they read as separate
               pieces installed onto the motor shafts. The base
               (motor_21_frame) is always assembled.
  * assembled — pulleys seated on the motor shafts at their gaps.
