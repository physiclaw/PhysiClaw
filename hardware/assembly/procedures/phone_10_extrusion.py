"""Phone-bed cross-beam — sub-assembly of one 230 mm Extrusion1020 with the
hardware that fastens it under a frame Y extrusion.

At each of the 1020's two vertical end holes (Extrusion1020(hole=True): an M5
hole 10 mm in from each end, centered in width):

  * a BHCS M5 × 16 enters from the BOTTOM and points UP — its head bears on
    the 1020 underside, the shank passes up through the hole and protrudes
    above the top face.
  * a hammer M5 T-nut sits on top, UPSIDE DOWN (boss/mouth facing down toward
    the beam) — its threaded boss receives the screw shank. In the next step
    this nut slides into the downward-facing slot on the bottom of the frame Y
    extrusion, and the screw clamps the beam up against it.

Geometry in the 1020's native frame (matches Extrusion1020: width along X,
height native Y = 0 (bottom) → 9.9 (top), length along native Z = 0 → length).

Two variants:
  * exploded — screws dropped below the beam and nuts lifted above it, along
               the shared vertical (Y) install axis.
  * assembled — screws seated (heads on the underside) and nuts on the top
                face, threaded on the protruding shanks.
