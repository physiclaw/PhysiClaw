"""Phone-bed mounting hardware — sub-assembly of the PhoneBed plate with the
FHCS + hammer T-nut at each of its four ears.

Each ear has an M3 countersunk through-hole, recessed on the TOP (phone-resting)
face. At each ear:

  * an FHCS M3 × 8 seats flush in the top recess and points DOWN — its conical
    head sits in the countersink, the shank passes down through the ear and
    protrudes below the plate.
  * a hammer M3 T-nut sits below, MOUTH UP (boss toward the plate) to receive
    the screw shank. In the next step this nut slides into the upward-facing
    top slot of a cross-beam and the screw clamps the bed down onto it.

Geometry in the PhoneBed native frame (plate in XY, z = 0 (bottom) → thickness
(top, phone-resting face); ears at (±ear_x_center, ±ear_y_center)).

Two variants:
  * exploded — screws lifted above the bed and nuts dropped below it, along the
               shared vertical (Z) install axis.
  * assembled — screws seated flush in the recesses, nuts under the ears on the
                protruding shanks.
