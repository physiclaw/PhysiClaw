"""Phone bed on its cross-beams — the phone_20 bed sub-assembly set onto two
phone_10 cross-beams so the bed's four hammer T-nuts drop into the beams' top
slots.

World frame (Z up): the bed lies flat in XY with its top (+Z) up — the
PhoneBed native frame, placed at the origin (bottom face at z = 0). Each
cross-beam is laid horizontal with its length along X and its slotted top face
(+native Y) pointing up; the two beams sit at Y = ±ear_y_center so each catches
the bed's two ear nuts at that Y. Beam tops are at z = 0, so the bed rests on
them and its nuts (mouth at z = 0) reach down into the slots.

  beam orientation: native (x, y, z) → world (z, x, y) via rotate X+90 then
  Z+90 — native Z (length) → world X, native Y (height/top) → world Z (up),
  native X (width) → world Y. Then centered in X and dropped so the top is
  at z = 0.

Sub-assemblies are embedded in their assembled form. Two variants:
  * exploded — the whole bed assembly lifted in +Z off the beams.
  * assembled — bed seated on the beams.
