"""Phone bed mounted to the frame — sets the phone_30 bed-on-beams sub-assembly
under the tapz_20_solenoid_mount frame so the 1020 cross-beams' TOP faces meet
the long extrusions' BOTTOM (+Y) face.

In tapz_20 world the two long Extrusion2040 members run along Z (0 → 335) at
X = ±95; the gantry mechanism (solenoid mount / tip) is on the +Y side, so the
frame underside is the +Y face at Y = +EXT_THICKNESS (= +20), with a slot
centered at X = ±95. phone_30's 210 mm beams carry their frame-nuts at X = ±95,
so they line up with those slots.

phone_30 is rotated +90° about X: its beam-top side (phone_30 +Z) swings to -Y
so the beam tops seat up against the long's +Y bottom face (the beams sit just
below it at +Y); the beams stay along X (spanning both longs) and the bed hangs
on the +Y side with the phone facing back (-Y) toward the solenoid mechanism.
Then translated so the beam tops sit at the long bottom face (Y = +20) and the
pair of beams sits near the longs' mid-length (Z = 147.5, 20 mm toward Z=0).

Two variants:
  * exploded — the bed sub-assembly dropped along +Y off the long bottom face.
  * assembled — beam tops seated on the long bottom face.
