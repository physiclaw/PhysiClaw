"""Solenoid + tip attached to the SolenoidMount — extends
tapz_10_solenoid_tip by adding the SolenoidMount custom part and 2× M3×6
BHCS that tie the solenoid's left-face M3 mount holes to the mount's
screen-face middle-column 15 mm-pitch pair.

The SolenoidMount hangs in its "ready to bolt onto the BeltClamp" pose:
keyboard plate on TOP, screen wall (the L's vertical leg) extending
DOWN. The solenoid keeps its native orientation so the bottom-rod + tip
point -Z (down), ready to strike the surface below; the top-rod
actuating end points +Z (up) and exits the open side of the L
(plate-relative +X), clear of the plate. The solenoid is translated
+Y by solenoid_depth so its -X face holes land on the wall's middle
column (which sits at world Y = +solenoid_depth/2 because of the
mount's native +X → world +Y mapping).

Mount-hole alignment:
  * Solenoid native left-face holes at (-outer_w/2, -depth/2,
    ±mount_hole_z_spacing/2). After +Y translation by depth: world
    (-outer_w/2, +depth/2, ±7.5) — 15 mm pitch.
  * Screen-face middle column: i=2 of the 5-base pattern, face_X =
    screen_pattern_base_from_left + 2 × screen_pattern_spacing = 20 mm.
    Base-row pair (without screen_pattern_row_shift): face_Y =
    base_from_bottom + y_offsets[2] = 5 mm  and  5 + pair_offset = 20 mm
    → native (X=0, Z=6 / 21), 15 mm pitch matching the solenoid.
  * Mount placed with native +Y → world +X, native +Z → world -Z;
    derived native +X → world +Y. The wall BACK face (native
    Y = mount_width/2) mates against the solenoid -X face at world
    X = -solenoid_outer_w/2; the SCREEN face (native Y = mount_width/2
    - wall_thickness) faces world -X, where the screw heads enter.
    Pair midpoint at native Z = 13.5 maps to world Z = 0, centered on
    the solenoid's mount holes.

Two variants:
  * exploded — mount pulled MOUNT_EXPLODE outboard along world -X (away
               from the solenoid); each BHCS shank-tip floats
               SCREW_EXPLODE further along the same axis.
  * assembled — wall back face flush against the solenoid -X face;
                BHCS heads bottomed on the screen face.
