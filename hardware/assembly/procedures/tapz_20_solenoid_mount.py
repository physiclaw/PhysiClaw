"""Solenoid mount on the BeltClamp — extends belt_30_motor_b by
placing the tapz_11_solenoid_attach sub-assembly onto the BeltClamp's
top face. The SolenoidMount's keyboard plate flushes on the clamp top;
its 32 × 17 corner-hole pattern aligns with the clamp's top corner
holes, and the wall wraps DOWN over the clamp's front face so the
wall's CSK pair engages the clamp's front-face holes.

Orientation in tapz_20 world (rooted in BE30MotorB / BE20Clamp frame —
clamp native +X → world +X, +Y → world +Z, +Z → world -Y):
  * SolenoidMount native +Z (wall direction) → world +Y — wall hangs
    DOWN from the plate, parallel to the clamp's front face (which
    spans clamp native +Z → -Z, i.e. world -Y → +Y).
  * SolenoidMount native +Y (toward the wall) → world -Z — the +Y end
    of the plate is on the clamp's front-face side (world -Z), so the
    wall's screen face (native Y = width/2 - wall_thickness) lands
    flush against the clamp's front face (world Z = clamp front face).
  * SolenoidMount native +X (length axis) → world +X (forced by
    right-handed composition of the two axes above).

A single Location is applied to the tapz_11_solenoid_attach compound
to bring its tapz_11-world placement into tapz_20 world; the solenoid,
tip, and wall-to-solenoid BHCS travel with the mount as one rigid
sub-assembly.

Fasteners added at this step:
  * 4 × BHCS M3 × 8 — through the SolenoidMount plate's corner holes,
    into the BeltClamp's top corner holes. Each engages an M3 square
    nut captive in one of the BeltClamp's horizontal side pockets
    (2 per side after mirror = 4 total).
  * 2 × FHCS M3 × 10 — heads sunk into the wall's corner CSK holes
    (CSK from back). The CSK pair sits 12 mm up the wall (mount native
    Z = +13); after the wall is flipped DOWN that lands at world Y =
    CLAMP_TOP_Y + 12, exactly on the clamp's front-face holes. The
    shanks pass through the 4 mm wall and thread into the M3 square
    nuts captive in the clamp's vertical side pockets.
  * 2 × M3 square nuts — captive in the BeltClamp's vertical side
    pockets (1 per side after mirror), aligned with the clamp's
    front-face holes.

Two variants:
  * exploded — TZ11SolenoidAttach sub-assembly lifted outboard along
               world -Y by EXPLODE_OUT (away from the clamp top); each
               BHCS shank tip floats SCREW_EXPLODE further along the
               same axis. The FHCS travel with the sub-assembly in -Y
               and additionally lift out of their CSK along world -Z
               by FHCS_EXPLODE (their own outboard axis). The 6 captive
               nuts pull out along their slot install axes (world ±X)
               by NUT_EXPLODE.
  * assembled — plate flush on clamp top, BHCS heads bottomed on the
                plate exposed face, FHCS heads sunk into the wall CSK
                (wide top flush with wall back face), nuts in their
                pockets.

# coordinates to the new placement so the entire TZ11SolenoidAttach compound
# lands in tapz_20 world without rebuilding any of its parts.
#
# Rotation R takes mount-native axes as expressed in tapz_11 world to the
# same axes as expressed in tapz_20 world. Composing the mount → tapz_11

# which is expressed as Plane(x_dir=(0,0,-1), z_dir=(0,-1,0)). Translation
# O = M_20_origin − R · M_11_origin so the tapz_11 mount origin
# (-22, +6.5, +13.5) lands at (MOUNT_ORIGIN_X, MOUNT_ORIGIN_Y, MOUNT_ORIGIN_Z).
