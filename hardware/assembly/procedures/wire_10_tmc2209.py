"""TMC2209 stepper drivers on the board — plugs two TMC2209 carrier modules
into the MKS DLC32's driver slots.

Both are standard (purchased) parts: the bare ``MksBoard`` and the
``Tmc2209`` modules, shown on their own (no holder, no frame).

Each module's 2×8 male header drops into a slot's two 1×8 female sockets:
the carrier bottom (its ``mount`` plane, z = 0) seats on the socket tops
(z = pcb_th + HDR_HEIGHT), pins protruding -Z into the sockets. The board
lays its sockets out with the 8-pin rows along Y and the two rows
``DRIVER_ROW_PITCH`` apart along X (``_female_header`` rotated 90°), so each
module — canonically 8 pins along X, rows along Y — is rotated +90° about Z
to match. The pin pitch and row spacing are the shared ``_fits`` constants,
so the pins land in the sockets by construction.

Two variants:
  * exploded — the modules lifted off their slots along +Z.
  * assembled — modules seated, pins in the sockets.
