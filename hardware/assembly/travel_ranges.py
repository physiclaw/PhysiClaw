"""Single source of truth for the build's key size dimensions — X/Y gantry
travel, frame size, and the phone bed.

The two BASE knobs are ``X_TRAVEL`` and ``Y_TRAVEL`` (usable carriage /
gantry travel). Everything else is DERIVED from them:

    rail length       = travel + carriage footprint
    hosting extrusion = rail + end allowance (clearance to the end blocks)
    frame width       = X beam + clearance
    phone-bed beam    = frame width + two 2040 widths

So to change how far the machine reaches, edit ``X_TRAVEL`` / ``Y_TRAVEL``
and nothing else — the rail, frame (length and width), beam, and phone-bed
lengths follow, and the belt path, motor / idler / pulley-mount positions,
and T-nut seats all derive downstream and re-adapt on rebuild. (Note: X
travel widens the frame and phone bed; Y travel lengthens the frame.)

Caveat: a travel change alters the rail's mounting-hole count
(holes = rail_length // 20 mm). If that count changes, update the
``screw_hole_indices`` in ``linear_10_y`` (Y) / ``linear_32_x`` (X).
