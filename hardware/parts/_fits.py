"""ISO 273 metric screw clearance hole diameters.

Three fit classes:
  CLOSE  — tight; better alignment, harder assembly.
  NORMAL — general purpose; default for most mounting.
  LOOSE  — extra clearance; tolerates misalignment.

For FDM-printed parts, real holes print 0.1-0.3 mm undersized. Bump up
by ~0.2 mm above NORMAL, or use LOOSE, when the target is FDM rather
than machined. Test-print a tolerance gauge if unsure.
