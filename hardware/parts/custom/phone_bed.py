# ── Lightening cuts: hexagonal honeycomb ──────────────────────────────────────
# The bed is screwed to two 1020 cross-beams that sit under the ear rows (y≈±50);
# a rigid, light phone bridges the gap between them, so the body needs very
# little material — only enough to register and carry the phone to those beams.
# A honeycomb gives the highest void fraction behind thin walls (so it's cheap to
# print) while staying stiff and reading as an intentional, "designed" surface.
# The 3 mm walls bear straight down onto the beams, so support is unaffected.
#
# Pointy-top hex holes on an offset grid: every nearest neighbour sits one
# `pitch` away, so the wall between any two holes is exactly `hex_wall`. Centres
# whose hole would breach the body margin are dropped, leaving a solid perimeter
# (where the alignment walls and ears live).

# Upstanding fences on the top (+Y) and left (-X) body edges. The phone rests
# on the bed's top surface and is pushed into the top-left corner; its two
