"""PTFE-tube holder — a frame-mounted anchor for the solenoid wire's stiffener
tube.

Carries the same rib mount as the PCB holder (two M5 countersinks at
``mount_hole_pitch``, each dropping a hammer T-nut into a 2040 top slot). The
plate and the underside rib both run along Y out to the tube spigot's tip, so
they back the full length of the tall cylinder boss on the +Y end. The boss
holds a Ø4.3 coaxial bore that the OD4 PTFE tube plugs into. The wire is
spiral-wrapped to the tube alongside it (it does not pass through the bore); the
tube just gives the bundle stiffness and this socket anchors its fixed end to
the frame — so carriage motion never loads the control board.
