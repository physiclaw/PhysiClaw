"""Simplified representation of the MKS DLC32 V2.0 CNC controller board.

A purchased part, modeled as a positional/visual stand-in. "Simplified"
means only the major components are included (many small headers are
omitted) — but every component that *is* modeled uses its real-world
dimensions and shape, including the cavities/pins a mating connector
plugs into. Component specs are sourced from the connector datasheets
(see the comments by each builder).

Footprint and mounting-hole pattern match what ``pcb_holder.py`` is
designed against (90 × 70 board, four M3 corner holes on an 82 × 62
pitch) so the board drops onto the holder's standoffs.

Coordinate convention (matches ``pcb_holder``):
  * Board centered on the XY origin; long axis (90 mm) along X.
  * PCB spans z = 0 (bottom) .. ``pcb_th`` (top). Components sit on +Z.
  * +Y is the motor-connector edge (image top), -Y is the USB/power edge
    (image bottom), -X is the spindle-terminal edge (image left).

Components modeled (from the "MKS DLC32 Interface introduction" diagram):
  chip (ESP32-WROOM-32), DC power input, USB-PC, CNC spindle terminal,
  three stepper-driver slots, X/Y1/Y2/Z motor connectors, four corner
  mounting holes, and the electrolytic capacitors.
