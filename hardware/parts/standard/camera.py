"""Camera — a webcam-style rounded bar (82 × 26 × 25 mm).

  * Bottom face (−Z): the lens — a short barrel with a recessed glass disc.
  * Top: heavily filleted so the whole upper shell reads as a soft, rounded,
    hand-friendly form rather than a hard box.
  * Front face (+Y): a 1/4"-20 female socket for mounting on a 1/4-20 stud
    (e.g. the gooseneck's male tip). Threads are representational (a smooth
    tapped-minor bore, like the gooseneck socket).

Canonical frame: long axis along X, centered in X/Y, bottom face at z = 0
(lens looking down −Z), top at z = height.

Run from the repo root:

    uv run --group cad python -m hardware.parts.standard.camera
