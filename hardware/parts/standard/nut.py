# Square nut: DIN 557 regular pattern, nominal dims for M4/M5. DIN 557
# itself starts at M4; the M3 entry below is non-spec, sized to match the
# M3 hex nut (af / thickness / bore borrowed from ISO 4032) so M3 hex and
# square share hardware. DIN 557 doesn't spec a chamfer; the chamfer here
# is a visual touch so the part doesn't read as a raw CAD primitive.
# `af` is across-flats (hex) / side length (square). `bore` is the nominal
# thread Ø — threads aren't modeled, so the through-hole is a smooth
# cylinder of that diameter. The chamfer terminates at the inscribed
# circle (radius = af / 2) for both shapes — the cone never narrows past
# the flats, so only the corners get clipped.
