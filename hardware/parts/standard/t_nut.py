# 2020 T-slot nut half cross-section in XY (mirrored about x = 0). Each kind
# has its own profile because they engage the slot in different ways:
#
# "standard" — slides in from the open END of the extrusion. The profile
# traces centerline → bottom → trapezoidal flare → wings → step → neck →
# top, matching the 2020 slot envelope:
#   y ∈ [0,   2.8]: trapezoidal flare, half-width 3.25 → 4.5. Rides the 45°
#                   rib slope at the cavity floor.
#   y ∈ [2.8, 3.3]: wings, half-width 4.5 (full 9.0). Sits behind the slot
#                   lip — this is what locks the nut against pull-out.
#   y ∈ [3.3, 4.5]: neck, half-width 3.0 (full 6.0). Passes through the
#                   6.2 mm slot mouth.
#
# "hammer" — tilted-insert: slim flat plate (full width 10, height 1.5) with
# a chamfered bottom corner so it can be tipped on edge through the 6.2 mm
# slot mouth, then rotated flat to lock the 10 mm width behind the lip.
