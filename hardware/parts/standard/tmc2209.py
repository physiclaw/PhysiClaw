"""TMC2209 stepper-driver module (StepStick / Pololu carrier form factor).

A purchased part, modeled as a positional/visual stand-in: the black
carrier PCB, the exposed gold chip thermal pad, the black plastic header
bodies that brace the pins, the teardrop solder joints on the top face,
and the 2×8 male header pins that plug down into the board's driver slots.

Dimensions follow the standard StepStick carrier (e.g. BIGTREETECH
TMC2209 V1.3): 20.32 × 15.24 mm PCB (0.8" × 0.6"), 16 pins on a 2.54 mm
pitch arranged 2×8, the two rows 12.7 mm apart. The pin pitch and
row-to-row spacing are the shared ``_fits`` interface constants, so this
module is guaranteed to mate with the board's ``_female_header`` sockets.

Canonical frame: carrier PCB bottom on z = 0 (the mating plane), pins
protrude in -Z (into the sockets). The 8-pin rows run along X; the two
rows straddle Y. A ``mount`` joint at the carrier-bottom center seats the
module on top of a driver slot.
