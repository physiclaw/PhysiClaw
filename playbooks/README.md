# Shared playbook packs

Template packs for the conductor — the deterministic walks it runs
against a phone. Like `skills/`, these ship with the repo so a
task one user has rehearsed can be adopted by another with minimal
adaptation.

## Pack layout — a manifest, one folder per playbook

A pack is a folder. The manifest names the app and holds what every
playbook of that app shares; each playbook is its own file beside it,
the way a Helm chart is one `Chart.yaml` beside one template per
resource, and a Maestro workspace one `config.yaml` beside one flow
per journey:

    <app>/
    ├── APP.yml              # the MANIFEST: meta + placeholders + landmarks + shared pages
    ├── README.md            # for people: what the pack does, the device, the traps (never loaded)
    ├── macros/<n>.yml       # the pack's hands (recorded gestures) every route shares
    └── <name>/              # one playbook per folder; the folder is the name
        ├── PLAYBOOK.yml     # the route: name (= the folder), description, enabled, inputs, route
        ├── macros/<n>.yml   # this route's own recorded hands (dispatch <app>/<name>.<n>)
        ├── prompts/<n>.md   # this route's prose for the model (`prompt: prompts.<n>`)
        └── README.md        # the route's notes for people (never loaded)

A folder with `APP.yml` is a pack; a folder inside it with `PLAYBOOK.yml`
is a playbook; `macros/` and `prompts/` hold leaf files and are never
mistaken for one. A name resolves against the pack's `macros/` plus the
route's own, and may not appear in both, so there is no lookup order.
`APP.yml` never carries a route. Every section is optional, so an
empty file is a valid pack (the file is the pack marker):

- `app` (must equal the folder when present) and `description` (what
  the pack automates and when to adopt it — `install` prints it)
- `placeholders:` — per-installation constants (the `inputs:` of
  `action.yml`): prompt prose + example per token
- `landmarks:` — named fixed spots (`{label, at, [page]}`) the
  pack's recover hands tap and its agent episodes are granted by name;
  a `page:` scope offers the spot only while that page reads
- `pages:` — fingerprints more than one route lands on (a page only
  one route uses may be declared beside its waypoint instead). Anchors
  are the texts that identify the page and EVERY one must show, so
  declare few, unmistakable texts — alternate readings of one text go
  inside it (`text: [..]`), `within:` pins it to a band or a box, a
  `forbid:` term showing reads the page out; no score, a screen reading
  exactly one page whole is that page — semantics only; geometry is
  learned on-device via
  `physiclaw playbooks pages calibrate`. A page here may carry its
  `recover:` hand too — a gesture, a landmark tap, or a pack macro by
  name — which every route inherits unless it declares its own.

`<name>/PLAYBOOK.yml` is the playbook, headed like a macro or a skill: `name`
(must equal the folder's), `description` (the line the activation menu
shows — name the app the way users say it, 淘宝 not taobao, so two
packs offering the same task read apart), `enabled`, `inputs` (a
`default:` makes one optional; the boot's menu says so), and
`route` — a ROUTE of `page:` waypoints (checked every time, each
optionally declaring its own `recover:` — one hand (`go_back`,
`{tap: landmarks.<name>}`, `{macro: <name>}`), or
`covered:`/`elsewhere:`/`locked:` hands per reading, with `tries:`
beside it)
alternating with moves — `start` (the cold launch, usually a pack
macro every route shares), `do` (a recorded macro), `agent` (the
model drives inside your prompt's fence, with the tools, the `give:`
grants — landmarks to tap, pack macros to run — the `never_tap:` targets
its taps may never land on (never shown to the model, so a pay button
stays unnameable), the `context:` you
list, and `think:` — off, low, medium or high — how much hidden
thinking each of its calls may spend; a vendor whose thinking is a
switch, Kimi K2.x, reads low as off and cannot bound the rest, so keep
its micro calls at off or low), `ask` (human gate; `yes:`/`no:` are the replies it reads,
`wait:` and `rounds:` its patience, `total_label:` the label a payment total sits beside,
`think:` how much the model may think when it reads a reply those words miss,
`resume:` re-enters the app), `tell`. Any entry, a page included, may
say `on_fail: stop|handover` — what a failure of that entry does once
its own means are spent: hand the session to the model with every tool
(the default), or end it so the next wake reads the thread again. The
playbook decides; after a fired payment a stop leaves the order
unverified and unreported, which the next wake may read as still open. A move's enter/verify checks
derive from the adjacent waypoints; there is no branching and no loop
— judgment is an `agent` step, approval is an `ask`. What the playbook
declares is what runs: a page without `recover:` hands over, and
nothing retries or unlocks in the background.

## Values, and the one check shape

Three spellings, filled at three times:

| Spelling                                        | Filled                                        | Lives in                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `<<TOKEN>>`                                     | at install, from `placeholders.yml`           | any string in the pack, macros included              |
| `{inputs.x}`, `{node.field}`, `{ask.total}`     | when the walk reaches the move                | a move's `with:`, an `ask`/`tell` `message:`, a prompt |
| `{x}`                                           | when the macro runs, from the move's `with:`  | a macro's steps and checks                           |

A check reads the same everywhere it appears — a macro step's `require`
/ `forbid` / `expect` / `when` / `skip_when`, a page's anchors:

    "text"                              the text shows
    ["text", "alt"]                     any of them (alternate readings)
    {text: "t" | [alts], within: top}   in a band (top / bottom / left /
                                        right) or a [l, t, r, b] box
    {and: [..]}  {or: [..]}  {not: ..}  combinators (macro checks only)

Adaptation notes and the rehearsal checklist ride as comments in the
files.

`channel/` is the conductor's own pack: the thread page, the
send/open macros an `ask` runs, and `boot/` — the walk every wake
plays before any playbook (reach the thread, read the request, hand
the matching playbook the baton). Its `select` step is the one
entry only that file may carry; the hands and limits around it are
yours to edit, step, and replay like any route.

## Install

    physiclaw playbooks install playbooks/taobao
    physiclaw playbooks install playbooks/channel --set CONTACT=QiaoQian

`install` copies a pack into `~/.physiclaw/playbooks/<app>` VERBATIM —
tokens stay in the files, diffable against this template forever — and
records their values in `~/.physiclaw/playbooks/placeholders.yml`,
prompting (with the manifest's prose) for any token that has no value
yet. `APP.yml` and every README install with the pack, so the docs travel with it.

When physiclaw runs from a source checkout, these template packs load
directly (repo edits are live, no install step); a same-named pack
installed at home shadows the tree's.

## Placeholders

`<<CONTACT>>`-style tokens mark per-installation constants (the IM
contact name of your user thread, in these packs). Values live ONLY in
the local `playbooks/placeholders.yml`; every parser fills tokens from
it at load and rejects a token with no value, so a template adopted
without values fails loudly instead of tapping around looking for the
literal string.

Placeholders are deliberately not playbook inputs: inputs are per-run
values the activation extracts from the user's message, while a
placeholder is a constant of your installation that also lives where
inputs cannot reach (page anchors, macro checks).

## After installing

Everything lands disabled — the rehearse-then-enable rule. Recorded
gesture coordinates come from the authoring device; on the same phone
model they usually replay as-is, otherwise re-record the steps that
miss. Each manifest ends with its own checklist; the generic one:

1. replay offline: `physiclaw playbooks replay <app>/<playbook> --session <id>`
   walks recorded screens through the real route and shows where it
   would hand over — no phone, nothing written; `physiclaw playbooks
   micro <id> [--model …] [--think …] [--reps N]` re-asks the session's
   recorded decision calls and reports valid replies, agreement with
   what the wake read, time and hidden tokens — the way to compare a
   model or a `think:` level before a wake runs on it
2. rehearse: `physiclaw playbooks run <app>/<playbook> --input k=v`
3. capture page geometry: `physiclaw playbooks pages calibrate <app>`
4. set `enabled: true` in the pack files

Every wake logs the roster (`conductor: playbooks on disk — taobao/buy
(disabled), …`) and the decision (`boot drives — offering …` or `plain
model session — <reason>`), so a wake the model drove alone says why.
While a walk runs, every reading logs its verdict (`read after peek —
match taobao.results (2/2 anchors)` or `unknown — buysheet missing 备注;
results missing 综合`), every decision
call logs one line (`micro parse_task (parse) → taobao/buy (0.90) …`),
and the walk's end logs its reason (`handing taobao/buy over to the
model — …`); `summary.json` lists the same ends under `walks`, and
`physiclaw playbooks stats` aggregates them from `runs.jsonl`, with
the decisions those walks made (calls, escalations, time, hidden
tokens per call kind) read off their sessions.
