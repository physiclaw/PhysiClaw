# taobao/buy

From the user's message to a paid order: `parse` derives the search
keyword, `launch` cold-starts Taobao, `search` types the keyword with
非直播 appended, the `pick` agent walks results to the buy sheet and
stops before payment, `confirm-pay` quotes the sheet's exact total and
waits for 好的 / 不用 (a 不用 is answered, then the session ends), `pay` is
one recorded tap, `report` tells the user.

## Recorded facts

- Search bar, paste bubble, and 搜索 key coordinates come from the
  results screen of the recording device and fire exactly as recorded.
- The pay button (免密支付 / 立即支付 / 提交订单) sits at the sheet's
  bottom; a two-step cashier gets its second tap only when 立即支付 or
  确认支付 shows.
- The pick prompt asks for a single pack matching the keyword and
  escalates when the matching spec is 缺货 or the sheet cannot show one
  exact price.
