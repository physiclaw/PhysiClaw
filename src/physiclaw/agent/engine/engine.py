"""Engine — native tool-call loop. Follows OpenClaw's 7 principles.

  1. Structure via provider API: tools=[...] + message.tool_calls, not JSON.
  2. Normalized at the boundary: Provider returns AssistantMessage; raw
     provider-specific fields (reasoning_content) stripped before echo.
  3. Real finish_reason preserved and routed (length / content_filter / stop).
  4. Arguments validated against JSONSchema before dispatch.
  5. Errors marked: failed tool_calls get synthetic tool_result(is_error=True);
     finish_reason="error" / "length" / "content_filter" drive recovery.
  6. Transcript stays API-legal: each ToolCall gets exactly one ToolResult
     with matching tool_call_id in the very next message.
  7. Loop is the driver: model → tool_calls → dispatch → tool_results → model.

Layering: the mechanics split across four sibling modules — this one
owns the session lifecycle (wire provider/MCP/tools/policies into an
`EngineRun`, drive attempts under the session-outcome contract);
`loop.py` owns the turn driver, finish_reason routing, and the
[note, one-other] shape (principles 3, 7); `dispatch.py` owns tool-call
execution (principles 4, 5, 6); `runspec.py` holds the shared wiring
dataclasses. The *judgment* — when to reject a turn, when to refuse a
call, what to warn about — lives in `policy.py` as policy objects on
`EngineRun.policies`; request assembly (prompt bundle, initial
messages, tails) lives in `assemble.py`, shared with the CLI dump.

    mostly harness-detected — max turns, provider exhausted, crash — so a

    one-shot first-run setup restart, and the jobless-WAIT follow-up. A
    session that exhausted its wall-clock budget reports `retryable=False`
    — a slow environment would burn every retry the same way.

    `model_ref` is a `provider/model` string (e.g. `"qwen/qwen3.6-plus"`).
    Parsed inside `_run_session`; the provider is instantiated via
