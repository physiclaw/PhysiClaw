"""MCP HTTP client wrapper for the engine.

Holds one MCP session open for the runtime process's lifetime — opening
a new session per agent wake would add ~100ms of handshake per cycle
and spam the log with "GET stream disconnected" on every close.
Module-level `get_mcp()` returns the singleton; `close_mcp()` tears it
down at process exit.

        The transport runs the handshake inside an anyio task group, so a

        Left alone it sails past every `except Exception` in the stack: the
        CLI's "cannot reach the server" message never fires and the user
        gets a raw anyio traceback, `dispatch` breaks its documented "never
        raises" contract, and `engine` — which catches CancelledError to log
        an operator stop — records a dead server as a deliberate kill.

        `_probe` is the answer: it settles reachability BEFORE the transport
        can bury it. It is a pre-flight, not a guarantee — a server dying
        between the probe and the handshake reproduces the illegible
        CancelledError, so the `except Exception` below stays even though
        the probe catches the common case. A CancelledError from here on is
        deliberately left alone — it cannot be told apart from a real
