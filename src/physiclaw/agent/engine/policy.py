"""Behavioral policies — the judgment layer of the engine loop.

`loop.py` and `dispatch.py` own the protocol invariants (API-legal
transcript, one ToolResult per ToolCall, finish_reason routing, retries)
and the *mechanics* of every interception (pop-and-corrective, blocked
ToolResults, trace events). Everything that is a product decision — WHEN
to reject a turn, WHEN to refuse a call, WHAT to warn about — lives here
as a policy object. Three interception shapes:

- `TurnGate` — inspects a well-formed assistant turn before dispatch and
  may reject it (the engine pops the turn, injects the gate's corrective
  as a UserMessage, and re-runs the turn). Gates own their one-shot
  state: constructed fresh per session, "reject once then fail open" is
  structural rather than a flag someone must remember to check.
- `DispatchGuard` — inspects a single tool call before execution and may
  block it (the engine returns the guard's text as an error ToolResult
  without actuating).
- `ResultObserver` — sees each executed call's outcome and may return an
  advisory the engine appends to the tool result.

Ordering is load-bearing and declared exactly once, in
`default_policies()`: gates run in list order and the first rejection
wins; observers run in list order and share the parsed screen-change
verdict (keyboard belief must update before the stuck guard records).
A new behavior = one new class here + one line in `default_policies()`,
plus a `Session` field when it needs state outliving the call — the one
current case is `BurnedMacro`, which reads `session.failed_macros` as
written by the run_macro handler. `loop.py` and `dispatch.py` stay
untouched either way.

      turn is still a close), pitfalls before memory cues (both one-shot;

      the stuck block (a linted call must not feed loop counters).
    - observers: keyboard belief updates before the stuck guard records.
