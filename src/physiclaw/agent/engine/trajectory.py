"""Session trajectory — the turn-tagged history of plan + scratchpad states.

The plan and scratchpad tails only ever hold the CURRENT value; a rewrite
overwrites the old one. But reflection (`reflect.py`) wants the *evolution* —
how the plan churned, which scratchpad approaches were tried and abandoned —
because that churn IS the turn-wasting-trap signal the agent should bank.

So the engine calls `record(session, turn, plan_updated=..., scratchpad_written=...)`
once per turn (after dispatch): the plan is snapshotted on EVERY `update_progress`
call and the scratchpad on EVERY `note(scratchpad=...)` write — each is an
explicit agent act (a re-plan, a re-write), even one that repeats the prior
content, and worth its own turn-tagged entry. A safety net also logs a drafted
plan / non-blank scratchpad that changed without the corresponding call (e.g.
the closing turn). At a hard close the pre-close gate injects `render(session)`
— plan re-plans and scratchpad writes merged into ONE `[t0]..[tN]` timeline
(oldest→newest, labelled by kind) — into the reflect corrective, so the model
reflects on the whole run as it unfolded.

In-memory only (like `Session`), never in `messages[]` and never on disk: it is
read exactly once, at reflect time. Both the retained-snapshot count and the
rendered char count are capped (`CONFIG.engine`), so a long session with a
full (8KB) scratchpad stays bounded in memory and in the prompt.
