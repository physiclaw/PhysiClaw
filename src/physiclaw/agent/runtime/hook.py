"""Hook registry — subscribe event sources to the runtime loop.

A hook is a no-arg (sync or async) callable that checks some condition
and returns a `Trigger` if it fired, or `None` if it didn't:

    @register
    async def phone_watch() -> Trigger | None:
        if <something happened>:
            return Trigger(description="phone screen changed", source="phone")
        return None

The runtime loop calls `check_hooks()` every interval. It runs every
registered hook in order, collects the triggers that fired, and returns
them as a list. An empty list means nothing fired. Exceptions in a
single hook are logged and swallowed so one bad hook can't kill the
loop.

`Runtime` imports `check_hooks` and `load_hooks` from this module
directly — the hook registry is not an injection point. Tests exercise
the same path by `clear()`ing and re-`register()`ing hooks.
