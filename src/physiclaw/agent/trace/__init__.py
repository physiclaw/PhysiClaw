"""Engine session logs — a daily human narrative + a per-session artifact dir.

`Trace` writes the per-day human log (through the shared
`DailyLogWriter`, the same one `agent/claude/session_log.py` uses, so
operators scan either runtime the same way) plus the session's
events.jsonl and summary.json, filing every frame a tool result
carries into the session's `store.Images` as it arrives; `RawLog`
captures the provider round-trips into wire.jsonl, with each inline
image replaced by a reference into that same store. Everything lands
under log/engine/sessions/<sid>/ —
self-contained (image refs are relative), so "share the bad session"
is one directory copy. The on-disk format is documented once, in
`store.SESSIONS_README` (shipped into the sessions dir and every
`physiclaw logs --save` zip); retention sweeps on session bootstrap
(`store._purge_old`).

One submodule per concern: `store` (artifact dirs, session ids,
retention, the shipped README), `format` (event/value rendering for
the human surfaces), `trace` (`Trace` + the summary accumulator),
`rawlog` (`RawLog`).
