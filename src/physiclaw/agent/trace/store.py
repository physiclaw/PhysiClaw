"""Where a session's artifacts live, how a session is named, and how
long its artifacts are kept.

Dir resolution delegates to `common.paths` per call — the same live
seam the CLI reads through, so every sink (`Trace`, `RawLog`, the
retention sweep) and every test re-point agrees on one source of
truth. `SESSIONS_README` is the format documentation shipped WITH the
data: written once to sessions/README.md and embedded in every
``physiclaw logs --save`` zip, so an analyst — human or AI agent — can
bootstrap from the artifacts alone, no source access needed. Update
alongside any schema change.

# PhysiClaw agent session logs

One directory per agent session, named `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<6 hex digits>`
(sorts chronologically; the id suffix is a unique short handle). All
files are UTF-8 with LF newlines on every platform. Timestamps (`t`)
are LOCAL time with millisecond precision — the session's UTC offset is
in the `env` event / `summary.json.env.utc_offset`.

## Files per session

- `summary.json` — start here. Session metrics derived from the event
  stream (schema v1): sid, started_at/ended_at (local ISO), duration_s,
  model_ref ("provider/model"), provider, prompt_hash, triggers,
  outcome {sentinel: DONE|WAIT|IDLE|STUCK|FAIL, recap, crashed},
  turns, provider_calls, conductor_turns (turns the conductor
  synthesized from an armed playbook — no provider request sent),
  micro_calls (the conductor's scoped decision calls; their tokens
  fold into usage), provider_time_ms, tool_time_ms, usage
  {input_tokens, new_tokens, output_tokens, cache_read_tokens,
  cache_creation_tokens, cache_hit_pct, by_model {model: {calls,
  failed, input, input_new, cache_read, cache_write, output,
  reasoning}}} — every bucket
  a bill needs; multiply each by the model's rate, tool_calls {name: count},
  verdicts {changed/unchanged/no_verdict}, walks [{app, playbook,
  outcome completed|suspended|handover|crashed|abandoned, node, idx,
  nodes, reason, micros, rescues, total} — every conductor walk in
  order, the boot's hand-on first; absent when no playbook ran, and
  the runtime log's `conductor: plain model session — <reason>` line
  says why], errors {blocked_plan,
  blocked_layout, blocked_stuck, invalid_args, unknown_tool,
  tool_errors, correctives, provider_failures}, stuck_events, images,
  env {physiclaw/python versions, os, platform, host, utc_offset,
  config.camera, config.compact}. Missing summary.json = the session
  was killed or is still running.

- `events.jsonl` — the engine's decision stream, one JSON object per
  line: `{"t": iso-ms, "event": <type>, "turn": <int, when turn-scoped>,
  ...event fields}`. First line is always `env`. Key event types:
  `wake` (triggers), `response` (finish_reason, tool_calls requested,
  elapsed_ms; `synthesized: true` = a conductor playbook turn, no
  request sent), `micro_call` (one conductor decision call: call, node,
  rows the decision saw, out or null when it escalated, confidence,
  detail, attempts, elapsed_ms), `walk` (a conductor walk's terminal moment — the
  fields `summary.walks` lists),
  `usage` (ONE per model call, answered or failed, written by the
  provider itself so no caller can skip it — call: turn|micro|curate,
  model (requested, provider/model), response_model and response_id
  (as the reply named them — reconcile against the provider's bill),
  elapsed_ms, input, input_new, cache_read, cache_write, output,
  reasoning (the part of output spent thinking), error (exception
  class of a failed call, else null); all-zero counts = the provider
  reported no usage; the field names follow the OpenTelemetry GenAI
  conventions' token buckets;
  `physiclaw logs <sid> --usage` tabulates them),
  `tool_result` (name, arguments, elapsed_ms, `text` — the result as
  the model received it, whole, a screen's listing included — and
  `images`, the session-relative paths of the frames it carried;
  gesture results also carry `changed`: true/false/null, the camera
  verdict as data),
  `walk_read` (one conductor screen reading, beside the tool result
  that carried it: app, playbook, after — the action read after —,
  node, verdict),
  `tool_blocked_no_plan|_layout|_stuck` (engine refused the call),
  `stuck_warning` (loop detector fired), `bad_turn_shape` /
  `*_checkpoint` (turn rejected, corrective sent), `done`
  (sentinel + recap), `crashed`.

- `wire.jsonl` — the provider round-trips: `session_start` (provider,
  model, prompt_hash, tool schemas) once, then per turn `request`
  (full message array) and `response` (raw provider reply,
  elapsed_ms; `synthesized: true` marks a conductor-composed turn —
  nothing was sent to the provider, and no request record precedes
  it). Inline base64 images are replaced by relative paths into
  `images/` — the file the frame's own `tool_result` wrote. `micro`
  records carry one conductor decision call's exact prompt and raw
  reply.

- `images/<HHMMSS>_<mmm>_t<turn>.<ext>` — every frame a tool result
  carried (typically .jpg), written once when the result arrived: the
  frames the model saw and the frames a conductor walk read without
  ever sending them to a model. The name is the local capture time
  (hour-minute-second `_` milliseconds) plus `_t<turn>` = the turn
  whose tool result carried the frame, so `ls` sorts them in capture
  order and each links back to its `tool_result` in `events.jsonl`
  (its `images` field) and to any `wire.jsonl` request that carried
  it. Example: `104542_123_t20.jpg` = 10:45:42.123, turn 20.

- `notes.md` — the agent's own turn-by-turn narration: one line per
  `note(summary=...)`, `- turn N — <summary>`. The fastest human read
  of what the agent thought it was doing, in order.

- `runtime.log` — a mirror of the runtime process's log stream for
  this session (uncolored, full DEBUG for `physiclaw.*` plus INFO+
  from other loggers): the turn-by-turn engine log, provider timings,
  warnings, and full tracebacks that the structured events only record
  as an error string.

- `mcp.log` — the MCP-server process's log for this session (camera,
  exposure/tune, gesture execution), written live by the server: the
  runtime publishes the active session id to a marker and the server
  resolves it to this dir and tees its log there. This is where to look
  when a view came back wrong (blur, glare, bad exposure). Absent if the
  server logged nothing, was not running, or predates this feature.

## Analysis tips

- Underperforming session? Check `images/` first — bad runs usually
  trace to what the model actually saw, not how it reasoned. Look for
  blur, glare, or a cropped/off-frame screen before blaming the
  prompt or the model. A conductor walk's turns read the same way:
  each `tool_result` has the listing (`text`) and the frame
  (`images`), and the `walk_read` right after it says what the walk
  took the screen for.
- Failure post-mortem: `summary.json` outcome + errors first, then grep
  `events.jsonl` for `tool_blocked`/`stuck_warning`/`bad_turn_shape`
  around the last turns, then view the matching `images/`.
- Cross-session stats: every summary is one JSON file —
  `jq .usage.cache_hit_pct sessions/*/summary.json`. For trends past
  the retention window, `log/stats.jsonl` (one summary line per
  session at close, both engines) survives the session-dir purge.
- Turn timeline: events with the same `turn` value tell one
  turn's story: usage → response → tool_result(s) (the provider writes
  `usage` as the call returns, before the engine records `response`; a
  `usage` with a `turn` but `call: micro`/`curate` is a side call made
  while that turn was in progress — curation at close carries the last
  turn's number).
- Cost: `physiclaw logs <sid> --usage [--json]` lists every model
  call's token buckets and per-model totals; cost is each bucket times
  the model's rate, summed — no price table is kept here.

Privacy: wire.jsonl carries full prompts (including the user profile /
memory) and images/ are phone screenshots. Treat a session dir as
sensitive.
