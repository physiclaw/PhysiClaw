"""Daily-log primitives — ``memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md``, the shared spelling.

The append-only daily log is the agent's activity journal (PERSISTENCE
doctrine: `[HH:MM] app: … — what you did`, one file per day). Two
packages write and read it — the engine (the model's `append_log` /
`read_logs` tools, the bootstrap memory slot, the external-stop
breadcrumb) and the conductor (a walk's payment and suspension lines,
the activation's recent-activity context) — and the two may not import
each other, so the file format lives HERE, the `verdict.py` precedent:
one spelling below the seam, both sides consume it.

`agent.engine.memory` keeps its public API by delegating; policy (what
to log, when, config-tuned window sizes) stays with the callers.
