"""Element-listing grammar — the shared element shape between core and agent.

One canonical shape, `Element`, with both codecs beside it: text via
`format_elements` / `decode_elements` (the listing an agent reads), JSON
via `Element.to_dict` / `from_dict` (`elements_to_json`, snapshot files).
Core composes through `format_elements` (`orchestration.perception`);
`agent.engine.compact._stub_body` parses rows back out with `parse_row`
when stubbing superseded views. Defining every side here means the shape
exists once — a formatter change and its parser change are the same
edit.

Three doc surfaces quote `LISTING_HEADER` verbatim for a model to read:
the doctrine (`agent/context/PHYSICLAW.md` § Element listing), the
`peek` tool docstring (`core/server/tools.py`), and the claude-engine
doctrine (`agent/claude/CLAUDE.md`). Those copies stay literal rather
than becoming a `{{token}}`: only the doctrine path renders tokens
(`common.doctrine`), while tool docstrings and CLAUDE.md ship as-is —
so `tests/common/test_listing.py` pins all three against this constant
instead.

Dependency-free on purpose: core composes, engine parses, and neither
should drag the other's imports (cv2 on one side, provider stack on the
other) into a string format.
