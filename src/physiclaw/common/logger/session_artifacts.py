"""Shared session-artifact surface for the two agent engines.

The engine (`agent/trace`) and the claude subprocess path
(`agent/claude/session_log.py`) each write a daily human narrative plus
a per-session artifact dir whose `summary.json` shares one schema (v1)
— one `physiclaw logs` / `jq` reads both engines' sessions. This module
owns the pieces that must stay identical between the two writers:

  - `DailyLogWriter` — the daily narrative file, session banner/footer,
    and midnight rollover;
  - `build_summary` — the summary.json shape, one constructor;
  - `iso_now` / `env_snapshot` / `write_json_atomic` / `image_filename`
    / `save_image` / `ensure_readme` — the helpers both artifact dirs
    are built from.

Each engine keeps its own event accumulation (their event streams are
genuinely different); only the on-disk shape is centralized, so a schema
change is one edit here instead of a lockstep pair.
