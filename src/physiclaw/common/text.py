"""UTF-8 by default for every text I/O.

``Path.read_text`` / ``write_text`` / ``open`` without an explicit
``encoding=`` fall back to ``locale.getencoding()`` — GBK on Chinese
Windows, cp1252 on Western Windows. That's bricked PhysiClaw twice
already (config.toml in 58aa00d, SKILL.md after). Route every short-
lived text I/O through these helpers so UTF-8 is the only default.

Long-lived append handles (daily log loops in agent/claude/spawn.py,
agent/trace, agent/engine/jobs.py) keep an explicit
``open(path, "a", encoding="utf-8")`` inline — wrapping a stateful
file handle in a helper would be more indirection than it's worth.
