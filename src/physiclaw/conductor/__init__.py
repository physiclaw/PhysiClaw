"""The conductor — deterministic turns for the routine parts of a task.

A peer of the agent, not part of it. The engine loads this package only
through the `TurnPlugin` seam (`contract.plugin`, named by the
`[agent] plugins` config path); neither package imports the other, and
`tests/test_architecture.py` enforces that. Each turn the conductor
either synthesizes the assistant message itself (no provider call) or
passes, and the LLM speaks.

Vocabulary, in the order a reader meets it:

    pack       one app's directory: APP.yml + macros/ + <playbook>/PLAYBOOK.yml
    playbook   one task in a pack, written as a route
    entry      one YAML item of a route (its leading key is the kind)
    page       a waypoint entry: where the walk must BE, checked every
               time; declared once (anchors), referenced bare elsewhere
    move       any non-page entry: start, do, agent, ask, tell
    node       a compiled move (pages compile away into the adjacent
               moves' enter/verify checks)
    walk       one playbook executing (`Program`), cursor over nodes
    step       the executor running the node at the cursor
    turn       one synthesized [note, action] assistant message; the
               action's result comes back as ordinary history
    verdict    the matcher's reading of a screen: match / occluded /
               unknown, with the page id
    hand       a declared recovery action: one gesture or one macro
    landmark   a named fixed spot the author knows ({label, bbox})
    grant      what an episode is given: a landmark (shown with its box,
               tapped like any other) or a macro (run by name)
    gate       the ask-and-hold state (reply words decide first; a reply
               they miss is read in the thread; consent)
    ledger     the walk's one account: task, decisions, said, paid
    thread     the session's conversation with the model about the errand:
               the parse, a vague reply, the closing record — append-only,
               the ledger's delta between calls, one cached prefix
    brief      the walk's last note: why it stopped, where it stands
    handover   the walk goes quiet; the model takes the session

One wake, end to end:

    plugin.session_setup  → setup: a suspension resumes, else the boot
    the boot              → Program over channel/boot/PLAYBOOK.yml: peek, the thread
                            page's declared hands, then `select` —
                            parse_task over the enabled playbooks
    the baton             → activation builds the matching playbook's
                            Program; the conductor drives it next
    the walk              → each node's step: a move's enter check, its
                            macro, its verify; an agent's fenced calls;
                            an ask's send, hold, and read; a tell's send
    a deviation           → the page's `recover:` hand, or handover
    the end               → completion (the walk closes the session DONE
                            itself), handover (one brief turn, the model
                            continues), a stop, or an ask out of patience
                            (suspended.json); the record writes the runs
                            row and the daily log
