"""Building a walk — the one `Program` constructor call.

`build_program` is how every door assembles a walk — the wake's
suspension and boot, the CLI rehearsal, the stepping tool, the offline
replay, and the tests — so a program is whole at construction (channel,
OS prints, any restored projection) and never patched up afterwards.
`load_spec` is the one place a playbook's spec and live-readiness are
read off disk for a named ref, `resolve_inputs` the one input resolver.
