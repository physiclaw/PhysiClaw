"""Drive one playbook on the live phone — the engine's loop without the
session.

No policy gates, no compaction, no trace, no sentinel: just the
conductor's contract — ask the Program for a turn, dispatch its one
action, feed the result back — so a rehearsal exercises the real walk.
`arm` loads and validates everything BEFORE any connection exists;
`walk` runs the loop over an open client and returns one of the
`WALK_*` outcomes below. `emit` receives every progress
line; the core never prints.

`playbooks run` is typer around it, `playbooks replay` shares `arm`,
and `playbooks step` (`debug/stepping.py`, the studio's driver too)
runs the same loop one node at a time with `Program.step_one` set, a
`transform` hook for the virtual channel, and `macro_opts` to narrow
the first macro run to a step range.
