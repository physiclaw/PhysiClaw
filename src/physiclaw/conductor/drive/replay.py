"""Offline replay — the real walk over recorded screens, no phone.

Every session records its listings; a replay feeds them, in order, to
a dry `Program` as the results of the actions it synthesizes, and
reports what the walk would have done: which node acted, on which
verdict, with which tool, and where it stopped. Nothing is simulated —
the same executors, matcher, lints, and money predicates run — so a
replay answers "where would this playbook hand over on that session"
without the arm, and every real failure becomes a regression case.

A pure-text agent step resolves from `outputs` (`node.field` → value,
what the author says the model would have answered); any other model
decision stops the replay at that node — the deterministic prefix is
what a replay proves. The program is built `dry`: no runs.jsonl line,
no daily-log entry, no suspension file.
