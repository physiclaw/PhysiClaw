"""Wake-time setup — the doors a wake enters a walk by.

Two doors, both fail-open (a missing, stale, or invalid file degrades
to a normal session, never takes one down):

  - ``load_suspended`` — a walk that asked the user something resumes at
    its stored node (one-shot; ANY wake resumes, the WAIT job is just the
    alarm clock).
  - the boot — nothing suspended, but enabled playbooks exist and the
    channel pack's boot playbook is live: the conductor walks
    `channel/boot` (the thread page with its declared hands, then the
    `select` step), which fires ONE parse_task micro-call over the
    playbook menu (`activation.py`) and hands the program it built on
    as its baton.

A playbook on disk IS the grant; there is nothing to pre-declare. And
every wake logs the verdict: the roster of playbooks on disk with
their states, then the boot's offer or the one reason it stays quiet.

``session_setup`` is the plugin's single wake-time setup call
(`plugin.py` runs it behind the seam): it resolves those doors in
priority order and assembles the hidden qualified-macro registry —
every pack plus the channel on the boot path (the boot may activate
any playbook, so all conductor hands must be dispatchable); a live
program narrows it to its own pack + channel (`walk_registry`), and no
channel means a channel-less registry. Construction itself is
`build.py`'s.
