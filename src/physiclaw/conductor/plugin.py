"""The conductor as a turn plugin — the package's one composition point.

`contract.plugin.TurnPlugin` is the seam: the engine loads this module
by its config-listed dotted path (`[agent] plugins`) and never imports
the conductor's name. Everything the engine used to wire by hand lands
here instead — `setup.session_setup()` at wake, the micro-caller with
its cheap-tier client, and the `Conductor` arbiter per turn.

The micro-caller wiring: None only when nothing drives (no program —
the boot, a resumed walk; an agent step can fire on any live walk,
and the owned client is built lazily on the FIRST call, so wiring
costs nothing at wake); `[conductor] micro_model`
selects the cheap decision tier, ours to close (`aclose`); fail-open to
the session provider on any problem, at parse time or build time.
