The IM thread's page fingerprint, the rehearsed send/open macros, and
the boot playbook (`boot/PLAYBOOK.yml` — the walk every wake plays before any
app playbook), recorded and declared on-device like any pack — but
app playbooks never name it: asks reach it through the conductor's
node types, and the boot is the conductor's own to run. The
convention names live in `conventions.py`.
