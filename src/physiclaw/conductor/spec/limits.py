"""Every bound a walk runs under, in one place.

The conductor promises that everything it does is bounded: a route has
at most so many moves, an episode so many calls, a page so many
recoveries, the boot so many history scrolls. Those numbers used to
sit beside the code that enforced each one; here they sit together so
a reader can see, in one screen, what stops a walk from running
forever. The modules that enforce them import from here.
