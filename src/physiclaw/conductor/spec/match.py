"""Open-set page matcher — which known page is this screen, if any.

Matches in listing space, never pixels: the camera pipeline is already
rectified to screen 0–1 coords by calibration, and pixel matchers have
catastrophic recall on same-screen detection (fleet-measured: same-page
label sets overlap at Jaccard ≈0.97 with bbox jitter p99 0.007, while
different pages sit at p90 0.13 — listing space separates by an order
of magnitude).

The decision is open-set, boolean, and fail-closed on action: a page
is this page when EVERY declared anchor shows and no forbid term does,
exactly the `require`/`forbid` rule a macro step's checks use; a screen
that satisfies exactly one page is a match, none is `unknown` (the
LLM's jurisdiction, with each page's missing anchor named), two or
more is an ambiguous `unknown`. A calibrated page whose missing anchors
sit under one overlay band reads `occluded` — a keyboard, dialog, or
popup over a known page is an event on the page, not a new page. No
score decides anything: the author chooses few, unmistakable anchors
and gives each its alternate readings. The matcher's most important
output is a reliable `unknown`.

Text comparison builds on the shared base rule (`common.listing.
label_hit`: single-char = whole-label equality, else substring) with
normalization and fuzzy tiers layered on top for OCR noise. This runs
per gesture against ~10 candidate pages × ~40 rows, so the tiers carry
cheap exact prefilters — the fuzzy math only runs where it could
mathematically pass.
