"""The playbook model — the grammar as dataclasses, and the pack it
validates against. A leaf: the compiler (`route.py`), the loader
(`pack.py`), the scaffold, and the walk all import it; it imports none
of them.

A pack is a folder: `APP.yml`, the MANIFEST (what the app is and
what its routes share — meta, placeholders, landmarks, pages; every
section optional, the file may be empty), one `<name>/PLAYBOOK.yml` per
playbook beside it (the file body is the playbook: name, description,
enabled, inputs, route; the stem is the name, referenced as
`<app>/<name>`, and `name:` must agree with it), and
`macros/<name>.yml` for the recorded hands
routes share. The manifest never carries a route.

A playbook is one app task written as a ROUTE: a top-down alternation
of waypoints (`page:` — where the walk must BE, checked every time) and
moves (what it DOES). The grammar, top-down (the YAML keys are the user
vocabulary and the model classes below carry the same names)::

    playbook  ::= description [enabled] [inputs] route
    inputs    ::= {id: {description, [default], [example]}}   # ≤ MAX_INPUTS
    route     ::= [agent...] [start] page (move page | ask | tell)*
    entry     ::= "page" name [anchors] [forbid] [scrollable] [recover] [tries]
                | "start" name macro          # the unconditional cold-launch
                | "do" name macro [with] [irreversible]
                | "agent" name prompt [tools] [give] [returns] [limit]
                  [context] [irreversible]   # the step handed to the model
                | "ask" name approve message yes no [total_label] [wait]
                  [rounds] [resume]           # payment: resume required when
                                              # a screen move follows
                | "tell" name message
                | "select" name [limit]       # channel/boot only, and last:
                                              # read the thread, hand a
                                              # playbook the baton
    recover   ::= hand                        # one hand for any deviation
                | {[covered: hand] [elsewhere: hand] [locked: hand]}
                # `tries:` beside it bounds the page; a manifest page's
                # recover: is inherited by every route, a route's own
                # replaces it whole for that walk
    hand      ::= go_back | force_quit | home_screen | unlock_phone
                | {tap: landmarks.<name>} | {macro: name | body}
    macro     ::= name                    # macros/<name>.yml — a recorded macro (pack or playbook)
                | {[inputs] steps}        # inline — the macro-file grammar minus
                                          # name/description/enabled

The route's shape IS the contract: an optional prefix of pure-text
`agent` steps and one `start` opens it, the first page is the start
contract, every `do` and every acting `agent` is followed by the page
it lands on (its landing check — the reflector, enforced by shape),
and a page may declare its own `recover:` hand — one hand for any
deviation, or one per reading (`covered:` a sheet over the page
itself, `locked:` the phone's lock screen, `elsewhere:` any other
screen), each page bounded by its own `tries:` under the walk-wide
ceiling. Moves fall through in
route order — there is no routing and no loop; whatever needs judgment
is an `agent` step inside the author's fence, and whatever needs a
human is an `ask`. Money runs in code: an `irreversible: payment` move
directly follows the `ask` that approves it (`lints.check_money`).

What the playbook declares is what runs — no more, no less. A page
without `recover:` hands over; an agent step runs the author's prompt
with the tools, landmarks, macros, and context the author listed and
nothing else; an ask's reply is read against the `yes:`/`no:` words
the ask declares, and anything they do not cover is the model's to
read; a payment ask names the label its `total_label:` sits beside, and
`wait:` and `rounds:` are its own patience.

Wiring is by placeholder, and every ref is dotted: `{inputs.name}` reads
a declared input, `{move.field}` reads an EARLIER agent step's declared
return field, `{ask.total}` a payment ask's quoted total. A
bare `{name}` is a load error. Dotted refs are playbook-level — resolved
to plain strings before any macro sees them, so pack macros keep the
stock single-name template grammar.

The loader (`pack.py`) turns files into these; the compiler (`route.py`)
and its lints turn a `route:` into the nodes.
