"""The pack door — `playbooks/<app>/` on disk → validated `Playbook`s.

A pack is a folder: `APP.yml`, the MANIFEST (what the app is and what
its routes share — meta, placeholders, landmarks, pages; every section
optional, the file may be empty), one `<name>/PLAYBOOK.yml` folder per
playbook beside it (the folder is the name, referenced as
`<app>/<name>`, and `name:` must agree with it), `macros/<name>.yml`
for the recorded hands routes share, and inside a playbook folder its
own `macros/` and `prompts/`. The manifest never carries a route.

This module loads and scans packs, spells the qualified `app/name`
dispatch key every macro site shares, and holds the live rule a wake
requires of a playbook. The model is `model.py`; the compiler is
`route.py`.
