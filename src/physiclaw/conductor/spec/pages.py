"""Page declarations + learned geometry — the two halves of a fingerprint.

A page fingerprint is split by audience:

  - DECLARATIONS (the pack file's ``pages:`` section, human-authored): the page's
    name, which label texts identify it, forbid terms, coarse region hints.
    Semantics only — portable across devices and app versions.
  - LEARNED (``learned/pages/<app>.json``, machine-written by capture):
    anchor positions and tolerances, OCR variants. Geometry is ALWAYS
    captured on-device, never authored or shipped — iPhone models, iOS
    and app versions make shipped geometry infeasible (the same reason
    first-run layout learning exists).

``PagePrint`` merges the two at load; a declared page with no learned
geometry yet still matches, text-only — every anchor must show, no
forbid term may — which is what lets capture bootstrap from
declarations alone. Geometry adds position checks, the scroll vote,
the overlay reading, and mined OCR variants; it never adds a score.
