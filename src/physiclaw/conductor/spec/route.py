"""The route compiler — `route:` → the compiled moves, the start page,
and each page's declared recovery hand; the whole-route lints are
`lints.py`.

Waypoints do not become nodes — they become the adjacent moves' checks:
a `do`'s (and an acting `agent`'s) enter is the nearest preceding page,
its verify the page that must follow it. The route opens with an
optional prefix of pure-text `agent` steps and an optional `start` (the
unconditional cold launch); the first page is the start contract. Moves
fall through in route order — an `ask` once approved, a `tell` once its
message landed — and past the last entry the walk is done.

An inline macro is single-use by construction: its name is synthesized
`<playbook>.<move>` or `<playbook>.<name>.<role>`, dot-joined, a
spelling no directory macro can take, so the pack's dispatch namespace
never collides. Under an inline `macro:` the macro grammar applies
(single-name `{x}` templates); outside it, refs stay dotted.
