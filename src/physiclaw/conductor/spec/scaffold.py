# App packs

One directory per app, self-contained — everything its playbooks use:

    playbooks/<app>/
      APP.yml              the MANIFEST: what the app is and what its
                           playbooks share — app, description,
                           placeholders, landmarks, and a `pages:`
                           appendix for pages more than one route
                           lands on. Every section optional; an empty
                           file is a valid pack. Never a route.
      README.md            for people: what the pack does, the device
                           it was recorded on, the traps. Never loaded.
      macros/<n>.yml       the pack's hands, shared by every route
                           (same format as ~/.physiclaw/macros/, never
                           shown to the model's macro list).
      <name>/              one playbook per folder; the folder is the
        PLAYBOOK.yml       name (referenced as <app>/<name>, and `name:`
                           inside must agree) and the body is the
                           playbook: name, description, enabled,
                           inputs, route (page → move → page → move).
        macros/<n>.yml     this route's own recorded hands (dispatch
                           <app>/<name>.<n>); a name may not also be a
                           pack macro's — there is no lookup order.
        prompts/<n>.md     this route's prose for the model, verbatim
                           (`prompt: prompts.<n>` in an agent step).
        README.md          the route's notes for people. Never loaded.

Validate everything: `physiclaw playbooks check`. Scaffold a pack:
`physiclaw playbooks init <app>` — or start from a shared template
(`physiclaw playbooks install <dir>` records its `<<PLACEHOLDER>>`
values in `playbooks/placeholders.yml`; the repo's `playbooks/`
directory ships some, and when physiclaw runs from a source checkout
those load directly — home packs shadow same-named tree packs).

The route's shape IS the contract the checker enforces: an optional
prefix of pure-text `agent` steps and one `start` (the unconditional
cold-launch) opens the route, the first page is the start contract,
every `do` — and every acting `agent` episode — is followed by the
page it lands on, `{{inputs.name}}` refs name declared inputs and
`{{move.field}}` refs name EARLIER agent outputs, moves run forward
only, and `irreversible: payment` moves (do and agent alike) directly
follow an `ask` with `approve: payment` — the total the user consented
to is the fire-time bound.

What the playbook declares is what runs — no more, no less. An
`agent` step is the model's, inside the author's fence: `prompt:` is
the whole brief (refs fill once when the step opens; the conductor
adds only the output contract), `tools:` the closed gesture allowlist,
`give:` the landmarks shown to it each turn with their reading and box
(`landmarks.<name>`) and the pack macros it may run whole
(`macros.<name>`), `never_tap:` the targets its taps may NEVER press —
a reading, alternate readings of one target, or `{{label, within}}` to
say which band the target sits in; a granted macro's recorded taps are
held to it too; never shown to the model, so a pay button stays
unnameable, and a refused move costs one call while the episode goes
on, `context:` what to
load beside the prompt (`memory`, `memory.<slug>`, `daylog` — nothing
else travels), `returns:` the fields it must fill, `limit:` its
call/scroll budget, `think:` how much hidden thinking each call may
spend (off, low, medium, high — the vendor translates the word; the
reply's own `reason` field is always written); each episode turn the
model sees the screen as its own turns would — the screenshot beside
the whole element listing, icons and text rows with ids — and answers
a tool call the way its own turns would, one envelope for every tool
(`action` + `args`): `tap {{label, at}}` (what the box is; its box
`[left, top, right, bottom]`, a listed element's, a granted landmark's
or one read off the screenshot), `scroll {{direction}}`,
`back {{}}`, `run_macro {{name}}`, `done {{return fields}}`,
`escalate {{}}` — and `done` counts only on the following page, judged
by the matcher. An `ask` reads the reply against its own
`yes:`/`no:` words first (no model call when they decide); a reply
they do not cover is read by the model in the session's thread — the
same conversation that parsed the request — as confirm, deny, or
other, and other hands over (`think:` bounds that reading, as on an
agent step). A no is answered with the ask's `denied:` line, then the
entry's `on_fail` word decides. It waits by its own `wait:` seconds for
`rounds:` silent polls, and a payment ask reads the amount beside the
label its `total_label:` names. When the route completes, the walk
asks that thread for the record (the session's recap and the daily
log's memory line) and closes the session DONE itself.

A pack may declare `landmarks:` — named fixed spots ({{label, at,
[page]}}, open vocabulary) that recover hands tap and agent episodes
are granted; a `page:` scope offers the spot only on that page. A
page's `recover:` declares its recovery hand — a bare gesture
(`go_back`, `force_quit`, `home_screen`, `unlock_phone`), `{{tap:
landmarks.<name>}}`, or `{{macro: <name>}}` — or one hand per reading
(`covered:` for a sheet over the page itself, `locked:` for the
phone's lock screen, `elsewhere:` for any other screen), with `tries:`
beside it as its own bound — nothing recovers in the background; a page
declaring none hands over. A page's `anchors:` is the list of texts
that identify it, and EVERY one must show — declare few, unmistakable
texts; alternate readings of one text go inside it (`text: [..]`),
`within:` pins it to a band or a box, and a `forbid:` term showing
reads the page out. No score: a screen reading exactly one page whole
is that page, none is unknown (the log names each page's missing
anchor), two is ambiguous.

The channel pack (`playbooks/channel/`) is the conductor's own: the
thread page, the send/open macros an `ask` runs, and `boot/` — the
walk every wake plays before any playbook (reach the thread, read the
request, hand the matching playbook the baton), a route like any
other whose `select` step is the one entry only that file may carry.

Replay a walk offline against a recorded session's screens —
`physiclaw playbooks replay <app>/<name> --session <id>` — to see
where it would hand over before touching the phone.

A page is declared ONCE per pack — beside its waypoint in one file,
or in the manifest's `pages:` appendix when routes share it — and
referenced bare everywhere else; the same page declared in two files
is a pack error, never a merge.
Macros embed as `macro: {{steps: [...]}}` (the macro-file grammar minus
name/description/enabled, enabled with the playbook); an ask's
`resume:` and a page's `recover:` take the same form and dispatch
argument-less.

Limits: ≤ {max_nodes} moves, ≤ {max_inputs} inputs per playbook.
Macro format: see ~/.physiclaw/macros/README.md (identical grammar).

  # The lock screen. Telling "locked" apart from "a screen I don't
  # recognize" matters because they demand opposite actions —
  # `unlock_phone` costs 20-40s and does nothing on an unlocked phone,
  # while a recovery macro's taps land uselessly on a lock screen. Every
  # other unrecognized screen collapses into one arm, which is why no
  # other system page is declared yet.
  #
  # THIS DECLARATION IS A BONUS, NOT THE MECHANISM. Measured across
  # every state a real iPhone's cover can be put in — resting Always-On
  # Display, woken and fully lit, and after a swipe — iOS printed no
  # hint text at all, so the anchor below has nothing to match and the
  # page never reads. The matcher therefore recognizes the cover by its
  # SHAPE first (a clock and nothing else — `match.reads_as_locked`),
  # which needs no declaration and no calibration, and every page's
  # `locked:` recover hand fires on it. Keep this page: on a device or
  # version that DOES print a hint it is the sharper signal, and it
  # costs nothing when it never matches.
