"""Shared scalar layer for the conductor's YAML spec files.

A pack's manifest (APP.yml) follows the macro-file conventions — same
naming rule, same prose caps, same strict-string coercion hints, same
YAML 1.2 pure loader. The rules' one true home is the macro layer
(`macros/model.py` constants, `check_name`'s wording); this module
re-exports them for the conductor and binds the scalar validators to
each spec's own error class, so `pages.py` and `model.py` keep their
distinct catch surfaces without re-spelling the validation:

    _require_str, _prose, _opt_prose, _check_name = specfile.bind(PagesError)
