"""The ask-and-hold state — everything between "ask sent" and "consent
spent", in one object with one suspension projection.

The walk (`program.py`) owns the cursor; the gate owns the ask text,
the thread snapshot the reply is diffed against, the money numbers a
payment ask quotes and a `yes:` binds, the silence counter, and the
reply words the last send declared. Consent lives here rather than on
the ask step because the payment move AFTER the ask spends it, and a
suspension in between must carry it across wakes.
