"""Micro-calls — the conductor's three scoped model calls, one channel.

`parse_task` (the boot: does the thread assign a task a playbook
covers?), `agent_fields` (an agent step's pure-text call: the author's
prompt in, declared fields out), and `agent_act` (one episode turn: a
screen row, a granted landmark or macro, a scroll verb, done, or
escalate). Each call's shape is ONE row of `_SPECS` — role, answer
space, legend, outcome mapping; the texts are `prompts.py`, the
episode vocabulary `calls.py`.

The contract: a fixed-shape prompt, strict JSON out, and the answer
validated against the presented candidates and declared outcomes, so a
hallucinated option is impossible rather than unlikely; one repair
retry; `reason` before `answer`; a confidence judged against the config
floor; screen text enters only as a stamped data block. Anything else
resolves to no outcome and the walk hands over — escalation, never a
guess. `MicroCaller` is wired by `plugin.py` off the setup context, so
every round-trip lands in the trace and the wire log.
