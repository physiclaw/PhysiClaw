"""Money runs in code — the payment doctrine's predicates, one home.

Two pure functions, deliberately free of walk state so the money
rules can be read (and audited) without the state machine around them.
The walk supplies the numbers and acts on the answers:

  - `declared_total` — the amount beside the label the ask's `total_label:`
    names: the number the user is quoted and consents to.
  - `amounts` — every amount the screen shows; the ask records this
    set as what the user SAW, the fire-time check reads the sheet the
    same way.
  - `fire_block` — the two fire-time predicates, run against the
    CURRENT screen after the human's consent: staleness (the sheet
    must still show the consented total) and the bound (no amount
    above the total may have APPEARED since the ask — what the user
    saw is the limit; a struck-through original price they saw is
    not a change). None = pay; else the bare reason — the walk
    prefixes the move it was guarding and hands over.

Consent itself — quoting, binding, consuming — stays with the gate
(`step_ask.py`, `speak.py`, `gate.Gate`): consent is a conversation, these are
arithmetic.
