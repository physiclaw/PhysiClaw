"""One playbook mid-walk — the walk's core.

A `Program` is one playbook being executed. The conductor asks it for
each turn; it answers with a synthesized ``[note, one-other]`` turn, a
``DecisionRequest`` to broker through the micro-caller (fed back via
``resolve()``), or ``None`` — spent for good: the transcript of its
turns is the model's handoff, and every handover or completion mints
ONE last ``[note, peek]`` brief turn first (`brief.py`).

This file is the walk alone: the cursor and phase, the one action in
flight (`turns.py`), the page verdict every step judges against, the
declared recovery toward a page (`recover.py`), the money state an ask
binds and a payment move spends, the terminal moments, and the record
they write (`record.py`). What each STEP does is its executor's
(`step.py` is the contract), one per route entry kind: `step_do`,
`step_agent`, `step_ask`, `step_tell`, `step_activate`.

What the playbook declares is what runs: the walk opens with one peek,
starts at the route's first unsettled node (never below a resumed
suspension's cursor), runs a page's own `recover:` hand on a failed
check or hands over, and hands over on every blocked or errored call.
Money never recovers.
