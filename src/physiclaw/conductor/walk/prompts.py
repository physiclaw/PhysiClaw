"""The conductor's prompt texts — what its three micro-calls say.

Text only: the mechanism (`micro.py`) assembles the skeleton — role
sentence → reply contract → answer legend — and the rows there name
these. Kept apart so a prompt can be read and edited as prose, and the
agent rows stay what they are: the author's prompt is the whole brief
and the conductor adds only the output contract and, for an episode,
what its own screen block is made of (`SCREEN_ROWS_NOTE`).

    "newest message refers to an earlier request that is NOT "

    # A wake is usually the user's SECOND prod, not their first:
    # the run they asked for was cut short, so the newest line is
    # a nudge and the request it refers to sits above it. Reading

    # was asking for exactly the playbook on the menu.
    "WHICH request: normally the user's newest one — but when "
    "their newest message is only a nudge to carry on (a bare "

    "recent request above it that is still outstanding. "
    # The completion reply is what makes this safe to widen: the
    # assistant reports every finished task into this same
    # thread, so "already done" is visible rather than inferred.
    "A request is FINISHED — never answer it with a playbook — "
    "once the assistant has reported it done or the user "

    "tasks (even for the same product on another day) and never "
