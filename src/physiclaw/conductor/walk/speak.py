"""The walk's voice — how a step speaks to the user and reads what
comes back, over the channel pack (`channel.py`).

Both `ask` (`step_ask.py`) and `tell` (`step_tell.py`) send the
playbook's `message:` VERBATIM (only the author knows the user's
language) through the channel's send macro, land on the thread, and
baseline it; an ask later reads the bubbles that arrived since against
its declared words (`reply.py`), and any later send sweeps them for a
deny first. What is shared lives here once — the send door, the
landing rule with its deny sweep, the thread check, the new-reply
read, the verdict, the deny disposition — so the two steps cannot
word one rule two ways.
