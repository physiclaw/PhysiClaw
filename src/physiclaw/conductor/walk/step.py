"""The step executor — what every route entry kind implements, and the
`Walk` contract a step may rely on.

The walk (`program.py`) owns the cursor, the one action in flight, the
page verdict, and recovery; a step owns everything about ONE node at
the cursor. The walk asks a step three questions and routes by the
pending-action kinds the step declares:

  - `open()`       the cursor arrived — the step's first turn
  - `landed(kind)` one of its actions landed; the result view is in
                   `walk.screen` / `walk.verdict`
  - `resolve()`    the micro request it returned came back

A blocked or errored action is not a question: the walk hands over
with the error (nothing retries in the background). A step ends by
`walk.advance_cursor()` or `walk.handover(...)`; the walk never
inspects a step's private state.

`Walk` is the whole surface a step sees of the program — listed here
so the boundary is explicit and type-checked, and so a reader of any
executor knows exactly what it may read and call without opening
`program.py`.
