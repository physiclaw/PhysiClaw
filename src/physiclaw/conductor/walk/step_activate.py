"""The `select` step — the channel boot's own, and its last: read the
thread, select the playbook it asks for.

At wake the conductor walks the channel pack's boot playbook
(`channel/boot/PLAYBOOK.yml`): the thread page with the hands it declares for
a locked phone or a stray screen, then this step. On the thread it
fires ONE `parse_task` micro-call over the menu of enabled playbooks
(`activation.Activation`); a positive answer becomes the walk's BATON —
the program the conductor drives next — and anything else ends the
boot quietly, the model already standing on the thread. The invariant
is `agent/context/AGENT.md`'s "open the user's chat thread every
wake"; the boot route is who executes it, in synthesized turns and no
provider calls.

One thing learned from recorded sessions lives here: the request may
sit above the fold. A wake is usually the user's SECOND prod — the
newest bubble is a nudge and the request it refers to sits above it —
so parse_task's `scroll_up` escape swipes the thread up (bounded by
the step's `limit: {scrolls}`) and the re-ask reads the ACCUMULATED
listing, the newly revealed older labels seamed onto the ones already
seen (`merge_labels`).
