"""The `agent` step — the model's move, inside the author's fence.

No tools = one pure-text call filling the declared `returns` (prompt
in, fields out, no screen). Tools = an EPISODE: each turn one
constrained call (append-only context, so every request's prefix is
byte-identical to the previous one and the provider cache pays for all
but the newest block) whose answer the walk grounds to a live bbox — a
screen row, a granted landmark, a scroll or back verb, `done`, or
`escalate` — or runs by name (a granted pack macro); never
coordinates. A landmark scoped to a page is offered only while that
page is the verified reading. `done` is audited against the adjacent
verify page by the matcher, never trusted, and a payment episode
re-runs the money predicates before EVERY tap or macro the model
proposes.
