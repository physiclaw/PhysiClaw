"""The `do` step — one recorded macro, framed by its pages.

Before the move: its enter page (when declared — a `start` has none
and runs unconditionally) must match the current screen. After it: its
verify page must match the screen the macro result carries. A payment
move additionally runs the fire-time money predicates in code on the
current screen, after the human's consent (`money.py` owns the rules),
and consumes that consent by firing.

A macro that fails hands over — nothing re-runs in the background;
the author who wants a popup cleared or a locked phone woken declares
it (a `skip_when` in the macro, a `recover:` on the page).
