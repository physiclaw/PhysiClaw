"""The `tell` step — message the user, and the walk moves on.

The playbook's `message:` goes verbatim over the channel (`speak.py`
is the shared voice); once the send lands on the thread the step is
done and the next node runs — nothing waits, nothing suspends. A
trailing tell is the walk's last word, so the walk completes right
after it. Whatever the user writes back is the next wake's business:
the boot reads the thread then and parse_task decides whether it is a
new request.
