"""Synthesized turns — the shape the conductor speaks to the loop in.

Everything the conductor does to the phone, it does by MINTING A TURN:
a ``[note, one-other]`` assistant message, the shape the loop enforces
on model turns, so dispatch, the phone-protection guards, compaction,
and the wire log see an ordinary turn (`AssistantMessage.synthesized`
skips only the judgment gates). The loop dispatches the tool calls and
the results come back as history, read by call id (`views.result_for`).

`Turnsmith` owns the round trip — mint (`synth`) and settle (`settle`)
— and `Pending` is the memo of the one action in flight: its kind, its
call id, and whether it lands on the user thread (the synth site
declares that). What a kind MEANS and what to do about a failure are
the walk's.
