"""Per-walk outcome log — ``playbooks/runs.jsonl``, the escalation KPI's data.

One machine-written line per walk, appended at its FIRST terminal
moment (`record.py`; wakes and rehearsals alike)::

    {"ts", "session", "app", "playbook", "outcome", "node", "idx",
     "nodes", "reason", "micros", "rescues", ["values", "total"]}

``outcome`` is an `Outcome`; ``rescues`` counts recovery actions;
``node``/``idx`` locate where the walk ended (``node`` null past the
last node); ``values`` and ``total`` ride a completed line. Telemetry
only — read by `playbooks stats` and `propose`, never into a prompt
(the human-readable record is the daily log). Never fatal: a write
failure logs, an unparseable line is skipped. Append-only, no cap.
