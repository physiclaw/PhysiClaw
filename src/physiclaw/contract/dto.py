"""Data-transfer objects — the single shape the engine loop operates on.

Every provider serializes messages, tool_calls, finish reasons, and
assistant content differently. These DTOs normalize that boundary: the
engine deals only in DTOs; provider classes own translation to/from
their native wire format (`AnthropicProvider` → `/v1/messages` blocks,
`OpenAICompatibleProvider` → `/chat/completions` dicts, etc.). Provider-
specific leakage (e.g. Qwen's `reasoning_content`, Anthropic's
`thinking` blocks) is stripped before assistant content lands in
history — those fields don't survive re-serialization.

The DTO hierarchy mirrors what every chat-completion API exposes — four
message kinds and two content-block kinds — without committing to any
one API's encoding:

  Message kinds:
    - `SystemMessage`     — the system prompt
    - `UserMessage`       — user-role content (text, optionally + images)
    - `AssistantMessage`  — model response (text + tool_calls + usage)
    - `ToolResultMessage` — paired result of a `ToolCall` by id

  Content blocks (inside Message.content when multipart):
    - `TextBlock`   — plain text
    - `ImageBlock`  — base64-encoded image bytes + media_type

`Usage` is a normalized cache-aware token count populated by each
provider from its native usage block. The engine reads it via
`AssistantMessage.usage` for the per-turn cache-summary log; the raw
provider response is preserved on `AssistantMessage.raw` for trace
replay / debugging.
