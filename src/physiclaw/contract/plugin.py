"""The turn-plugin protocol — a peer package takes the turn before the LLM.

Each turn, the engine loop offers the request to its plugins in
registration order; the first to return an `AssistantMessage` has
SPOKEN the turn and the provider is never called. This is arbitration,
not a middleware chain: turns do not flow through the other plugins,
because the question being answered is "who produces this turn", not
"how is this request decorated". A plugin that returns None is passing,
and the engine falls through — with no plugins at all (config
`[agent] plugins = "none"`), every turn is a plain provider call, which
is the rollback switch.

The engine knows a turn is plugin-minted because it received it from
`advance()` — provenance is structural, never inferred from call-id
strings — and dispatches it under that provenance: the qualified
macros a plugin contributed at setup (`SessionSetup.gated_macros`)
resolve only on such turns, so the model can never borrow them.

Plugins are loaded from dotted `module:factory` paths in
`[agent] plugins` (comma-separated). Config registration is deliberate:
we own every plugin today, so a config string the engine loads blindly
is the whole discovery story. The upgrade trigger to entry-point
discovery is a plugin shipping as a separately installed distribution —
do not build it before then.

Everything here is in-process for now, but the shapes are
serialization-friendly on purpose (data in, one message out): a future
remote worker is a second transport for this same protocol, with the
two sink protocols becoming events returned in the advance response.
