"""LAN bridge — phone ↔ server state for text, screenshots, and calibration.

Three data flows:
1. Text → clipboard: Agent sends text → phone displays it → tap copies → confirms.
2. Screenshot upload: iOS Shortcut takes screenshot → POSTs to server.
3. Calibration: Server controls page display, page reports touch events.
