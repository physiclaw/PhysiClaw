class BridgeState:
    """Shared state for the LAN bridge between server and phone browser.

    The phone opens /bridge in Safari and polls GET /api/bridge/state every
    250ms. The server returns the current state; the phone renders it.
    The phone is stateless — it always renders from the latest server response.

    Three data flows use this state:

    1. Text → clipboard via tap (page must be open):
       - Agent calls send_text("hello") → sets self.text
       - Phone polls, sees text, displays it large on screen
       - Agent's arm physically taps the phone screen
       - Phone JS copies text to clipboard on touch event
       - Phone POSTs /api/bridge/tapped → mark_clipboard_copied()
       - Agent's bridge_tap() tool was blocking on wait_clipboard(),
         now unblocks and returns success

    2. Text → clipboard via iOS Shortcut (no page needed):
       - Agent calls send_text("hello") → sets self.text
       - User long-presses AssistiveTouch (or any trigger) to run the
         "PhysiClaw Clipboard" Shortcut
       - Shortcut GETs /api/bridge/clipboard → server returns the text
         and calls mark_clipboard_copied()
       - Shortcut writes the response into the iOS clipboard directly
       - This path bypasses the bridge page and the physical tap entirely.

    3. Screenshot upload:
       - Agent taps AssistiveTouch on phone (via arm)
       - iOS Shortcut fires: takes screenshot, POSTs image bytes
         to /api/bridge/screenshot → receive_screenshot()
       - Agent's phone_screenshot() tool was blocking on
         wait_screenshot(), now unblocks and returns the image

    Thread-safe: accessed from async Starlette route handlers and
    blocking MCP tool threads concurrently.
