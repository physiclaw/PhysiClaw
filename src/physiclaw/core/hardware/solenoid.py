"""Solenoid stylus-tip actuator — the Z executor, driven via GRBL spindle PWM.

The stylus tip is pushed onto the glass by a solenoid (not a stepper Z axis):
the coil is fired through the GRBL spindle PWM pin (``M3 S<duty>`` / ``M5``),
and a return spring lifts the tip when the coil de-energizes. The tip sits at
a fixed mechanical height, so there is no Z depth to calibrate — only timing.

Hit-and-keep current profile (a solenoid burns its coil out if held at peak):
  - strike at ``HIT_S`` to pull the iron core in,
  - settle ``SETTLE_MS``, then drop to ``HOLD_S`` to keep it seated for a
    sustained press (long-press / swipe),
  - release with ``M5``.

On release the coil cuts instantly, but the spring rebound is slow
(~``RELEASE_MS``). We dwell that long after every ``M5`` so the tip is clear
of the glass before any following XY move — otherwise it drags a line across
the screen. Defaults were tuned on the MKS DLC32 bench rig; see
``scripts/grbl_solenoid_test.py``.

This driver depends only on two GRBL-transport callables so it stays decoupled
from the arm and is testable with fakes:
  - ``send(cmd, *, optional=False)`` — write one G-code line, block until ``ok``
  - ``dwell(seconds)`` — emit a planner-side ``G4`` dwell

SAFETY — a solenoid burns its coil out if left energized at the strike current.
Two guarantees protect the hardware:
  1. ``HOLD_S`` must be below ``HIT_S`` (validated at construction). The hold
     duty is the only level safe to *sustain*; the strike duty is for the brief
     pull-in only.
  2. Every method that energizes the coil de-energizes it before returning,
     including on any exception or KeyboardInterrupt (via ``try/finally`` +
     :meth:`_force_off`), so an error mid-tap can never leave the coil hot.
     :meth:`press` is the sole exception — it deliberately hands a held coil
     to the caller, who must release it; :meth:`held` enforces that.
The firmware (FluidNC ``off_on_alarm: true``) is a third, hardware-level net:
GRBL drops the spindle PWM whenever it enters an alarm state.
