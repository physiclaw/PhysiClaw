"""Linux implementations of platform-specific helpers.

Imported by ``physiclaw.core.platform`` on linux only. Callers should
never import this module directly — go through ``physiclaw.core.platform``.

The browser setup wizard (``/setup-hardware``) drives Linux entirely over
HTTP and needs none of the GUI helpers below — only ``ensure_camera_permission``
(a no-op here) is on its hot path. ``open_camera_aim_app`` / ``quit_camera_aim_app``
/ ``open_image_files`` are conveniences for the terminal ``physiclaw setup
hardware`` flow and degrade gracefully when no desktop app is available.
