"""Application assembly: construct singletons and wire registrations.

The MCP instance lives in `physiclaw.core.server.mcp`. This module owns the
hardware/state singletons and binds every tool/route module to that
instance. Importing this module has the side effect of fully wiring the
server — `physiclaw.core.server.__init__` re-exports the public surface.
