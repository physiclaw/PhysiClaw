"""All MCP tools — the agent's surface for controlling the phone.

Mental model: **See → Act**. Take a photo, pick a bbox, do something there.

Each docstring is consumed twice: the first sentence becomes the inline
`## Tooling` card bullet (via AST parse in `src/physiclaw/agent/engine/mcp_inventory.py`),
and the full docstring becomes the JSONSchema `description` sent over the
native `tools=` API. So the first sentence must carry "what + when" on
its own; param semantics and return shape go in the body below.

All tools are async — blocking hardware I/O runs in a thread pool via
asyncio.to_thread() so the event loop stays free for HTTP routes.

Source order here is wire order. FastMCP registers tools in decorator-
call order (module top-to-bottom), and the MCP `list_tools()` RPC
replays them in that order. The engine concatenates MCP tools + local
tools in `tool_schemas`, so the order in this file directly determines
where each tool sits in the provider's `tools[]` array. LLMs show mild
position bias, so keep the most-reached-for tools (`peek`, `tap`) near
the top and don't shuffle without reason.
