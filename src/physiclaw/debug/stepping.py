"""Stepping — one node of a playbook, or one gesture of a macro, per
call: the debugger's core. `physiclaw playbooks step` and `macros run`
are typer around it for an agent at a terminal; the studio's Playbook
and Macro tabs are HTML around it for a person in a browser. Neither
skin holds any of this logic.

Two granularities, deliberately separate. A playbook node runs with
its page checks (enter, verify, the declared recover hand), so it is
stepped whole, or its FIRST gesture only (`start_at`/`stop_after`) —
from the second gesture on, the screen is no longer the enter page and
the walk would recover instead of tapping. A macro is stepped gesture
by gesture with no page checks at all (`run_macro`, over the macro
runner's own step range), which is how a hand that misses is fixed:
run one gesture, look, tap by hand to recover, edit the step, run it
again. Pack macros (directory and inline) are addressable by their
qualified `app/name`, the same name a walk dispatches.

A step rebuilds the walk from a persisted position (`Program.state`,
the suspension projection, overlaid as a checkpoint: a recover hand's
restart walks below the cursor exactly as a wake's fresh walk would),
runs the node at the cursor on the live
phone through the rehearsal loop (`conductor.rehearsal.walk` with
`Program.step_one` set), and persists where the cursor stands when the
loop pauses. The user channel is virtual: an ask's send still runs on
the phone, but its observation is rewritten from `debug/thread.json`
(`interceptor.FakeChannel`), so the reply an ask reads is the one
staged here. No model ever takes over on a handover — the position
stays on the node so the author can edit the pack and step again.

The position file is a tool's scratch under `debug/` (never a wake's
contract: `conductor.suspension` stays the only cross-wake file).
