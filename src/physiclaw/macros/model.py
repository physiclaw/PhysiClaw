"""Macro shapes — the constants, the clause algebra, and the screen it is
evaluated against.

Leaf of the package's internal split (only `template` sits below):
`parse` (a macro file → Macro), `steps` (the executable step hierarchy),
`inputs`, `store`, `runner` and `stats` all depend on this module, never
on each other through it.

Behaviour lives here only where it is PURE. A clause deciding whether it
holds against a screen is computation, so `Clause.holds` belongs on the
clause; issuing a camera read to obtain that screen is I/O, so it lives
in `steps`/`runner`. That line is what keeps this module importable from
anywhere — nothing here reads files, YAML, or the rig.
