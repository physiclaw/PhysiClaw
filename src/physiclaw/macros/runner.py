"""Macro runner — drive a validated `Macro`'s steps and compose the reply.

One macro run produces ONE tool result: a compact step log followed by
only the LAST step's view (image + listing). Intermediate views are
dropped here, never sent — that is the token win the whole feature
exists for. Because the result ends with a normal fused view and carries
a single verdict marker in its first text block, `engine.dispatch`
treats it exactly like any gesture result (verdict parse, observers,
screen supersede) with no special-casing.

The split, top to bottom: `model` holds the pure clause algebra, `steps`
holds one class per kind of action with its own `execute` (plus the
run-wide state, `RunContext`, kept beside the steps that mutate it), and
this module owns what neither can — the loop that walks the steps and
the composition of the one result (`_completed` / `_aborted`). So
`_run_step` reads as the macro doctrine itself (budget, idempotence,
gate, act) with no per-tool branching left in it.

Nothing branches: a decided-failed check or a tool error stops the run
and reports where, and recovery is the agent's job with the returned
screen to work from. `start_at` begins at a step (by handle), reporting the
skipped prefix as NOT executed. Server-side safety (bbox validation,
AssistiveTouch guards, the hardware lock, auto-park) applies per step
unchanged; this module cannot bypass it.

Every result ends with the CURRENT screen, success or abort, so the
agent never spends a follow-up turn peeking: a fresh view rides along
as-is, and when the held one may be stale (a `wait` slept past it, or a
failed gesture may have actuated) it does ONE recovery `peek` instead.
If even that peek fails the header says so explicitly.

Takes the MCP caller as a parameter (`McpCaller` protocol) so the engine
passes its process singleton, the CLI passes its own client, and tests
pass a fake — no engine imports here.
