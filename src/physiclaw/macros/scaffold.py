## Format

- `name` (required) — must equal the file name; lowercase/digits/hyphens.
- `description` (required) — tells the agent when to use it. It, and each
  input's `description` / `example`, must be ONE line of at most
  {MAX_PROSE_LEN} characters: they render verbatim into the cached system
  prompt on every wake.
- `enabled` — absent defaults to true; set `enabled: false` to hide a macro
  from the agent (the `init` scaffold starts false until you rehearse).
- `inputs.<name>` — `description` required; `default` makes it optional;
  `example` helps the agent fill it. String values only; max {MAX_INPUTS}.
  `{{input}}` placeholders fill strings in the steps (`{{{{`/`}}}}` for a
  literal brace); `<<UPPERCASE>>` is reserved for install-time pack
  placeholders (filled from playbooks/placeholders.yml at load, never
  typed literally).
- `steps` — a list, max {MAX_STEPS}; each step is ONE verb with its object,
  plus the qualifiers it needs beside it:

      - tap: "Paste"                     what is pressed — the element's own
        at: [left, top, right, bottom]   on-screen text or a description; the
                                         box as 0–1 screen fractions
      - swipe: up                        up / down / left / right, with `at`;
        at: [0.1, 0.2, 0.9, 0.8]         optional `size` ({"/".join(gesture_vocab.SWIPE_DISTANCES)})
                                         and `speed` ({"/".join(gesture_vocab.SWIPE_SPEEDS)})
      - send_to_clipboard: "{{message}}"   the text
      - wait: 2                          seconds (0–{MAX_WAIT_SECONDS}); `expect` lives here
      - home_screen                      bare words: {", ".join(sorted(ARGLESS_TOOLS))}

  The verbs: {", ".join(sorted(ALLOWED_STEP_TOOLS))}. A press
  ({" / ".join(sorted(gesture_vocab.PRESS_TOOLS))}) fires at `at` exactly
  as written — nothing moves the tap under the hood, so a miss is visible
  and fixable (presence checks are `require`'s job). The object may list
  up to {MAX_LABEL_READINGS} alternate readings of ONE target
  (`tap: ["免密支付", "立即支付"]`), for the reader and for `require`.
- Step handles are derived, never written: `idx<N>-<verb>-<object>`
  (`idx1-home_screen`, `idx3-wait-2`, `idx8-tap-paste`; a long object is
  cut to {HANDLE_OBJECT_CHARS} characters at a word boundary, a readings
  list takes its first reading). The step log, the run log, the agent's
  `steps:` list and `--start-at` / `--stop-after` all use them.
- `when` / `skip_when` — idempotence, not branching: ONE check describing the
  step's POSTCONDITION. `skip_when: X` skips the step while X shows; `when: X`
  runs it only while X shows. Use ONLY when skipping leaves the same screen
  state as executing (don't tap the input box when the keyboard is already
  up; tap 跳过 only when the ad is up). Checked before `require`; free when
  the screen text is already held, otherwise one peek; never polls. A
  screen that cannot be read satisfies neither: a `skip_when` step then
  RUNS (skipping is an optimisation), a `when` step is SKIPPED (running
  is what it withholds — and those steps aim at pay buttons).
- `if_page: <name>` / `goto: <mark>` … `mark: <mark>` — a forward jump:
  while the pack's page already reads (as the conductor reads it, never
  an abort), the steps up to the mark are skipped, since they exist to
  REACH that page; walked to, the mark requires the page. Condition first;
  nothing else on either line; jumps one after another, never nested. A
  user macro has no pages and cannot jump.
- `require` / `forbid` — checked BEFORE the step fires, so they describe
  the screen the step NEEDS, never the screen the step produces (to wait
  on an app you just launched, use a `wait` carrying an `expect`).
  `require` must hold; `forbid` must not (`forbid: X` is
  `require: {{not: X}}`, kept because the popup-tripwire reading earns a
  name). A check runs ONCE: it is a predicate, not a wait. It reads the
  screen text already held, free, and peeks when none is held (step 1, or
  after a step that returned no view; `send_to_clipboard` keeps the held
  screen). An unreadable screen is never a satisfied check: a failed peek
  is retried once, then aborts with `could not read the screen` — retry
  the read, don't go fixing the screen.
- `wait: N` sleeps exactly N seconds and calls nothing (0 only with an
  `expect`, to check immediately). The arm's own gesture latency (several
  seconds per tap) already absorbs most cold starts — rehearse before
  reaching for a long wait. A whole run is capped at {MAX_RUN_SECONDS}s,
  checked between steps, and aborts with `timeout`.
- `expect` — ONE check, run after a `wait` sleeps. `wait` + `expect` is
  THE settle idiom: pause, then confirm the screen you waited for arrived,
  for exactly one camera read. It is valid ONLY on a `wait`: a gesture's
  own view is captured ~2s after the touch and is the same frame the next
  step's checks read for free, so an `expect` there would assert nothing
  new. To confirm what a gesture produced, add a `wait` after it.
- `hint` — rides into the abort report when this step's checks fail, to
  steer the agent's recovery.
- EVERY check — `require`, `forbid`, `expect`, `when`, `skip_when` — is ONE
  clause, in one of these forms:
      "WeChat"                                substring of the whole screen
      ["WeChat", "Weixin"]                    any of them
      {{text: "WeChat", within: top}}           element-granular, in a band
                                              ({" / ".join(BANDS)})
                                              or a [l,t,r,b] box; `text`
                                              may list alternates
      {{or: [c, c]}}   {{and: [c, c]}}           any-of / all-of
      {{not: c}}                               absent
  They nest up to {MAX_CLAUSE_DEPTH} levels — the cap is on NESTING, not
  breadth, so flattening siblings into one operator is the fix when you hit
  it. Any of them may carry `within`, which scopes the whole subtree; an
  inner `within` overrides the one it sits in. Single-character texts match
  a WHOLE element label (keyboard keys OCR as standalone letters) and are
  only allowed with `within` — `macros check` rejects them elsewhere.

## YAML gotcha — quote your text

Checks and inputs match LITERAL screen text. YAML silently turns unquoted
`true`/`false` into booleans and bare numbers (`007`) into numbers;
`macros check` rejects those with the quoted fix, and unquoted
`{{placeholder}}` parses as a mapping (also caught). Anchors and aliases
(`&name` / `*name`) are rejected outright — write the value out in full.
Habit: quote every text value.

## Best practices

- Rehearse before enabling; bboxes are only trustworthy because you tested
  them on this rig.
- Put `require` on the step that NEEDS the state, not on the step that
  creates it. A launch or navigation step is followed by a `wait` carrying
  an `expect`, so a slow start costs a little time instead of aborting a
  good run — and the abort, if it comes, names the launch rather than
  whatever step tripped three lines later.
- Check the steps where drift would hurt: taps at a FIXED position in a
  list that can reorder, and anything just short of a commit.
- Give text targets their REAL on-screen text as the object — that is
  what lets the tap follow a button that moved. Volatile text (prices,
  times, item titles) makes a bad object for the same reason it makes a
  bad anchor.
- Point a check's `within` at the SAME region the step is about to tap.
  Checking that the text is somewhere in a wider band, then tapping a
  fixed box elsewhere, passes the check and still hits the wrong row.
- Reach for `skip_when` whenever a step's effect may already be in place —
  the app reopening inside the last screen, the keyboard already up. It is
  what makes one macro survive several starting states.
- `home_screen` opens the App SWITCHER when you are already on the home
  screen, so a macro starting there wants a `skip_when` anchored on
  something only the home screen shows.
- Keep macros short and single-purpose. Anything needing a decision mid-way
  belongs to the agent, not a macro.
- A rising `consecutive_aborts` streak in stats means the app layout
  changed; re-rehearse.

`stats.json` here is machine-written; delete a macro's file and its
stats go on the next run. When sharing a macro, share the one file.

Fleet-wide switch: `[macros] enabled = false` in `~/.physiclaw/config.toml`
hides ALL macros from the agent; these CLI commands keep working so you can
still author and rehearse.
