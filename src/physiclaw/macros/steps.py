"""The executable step hierarchy — one class per kind of thing a macro
does, each answering `execute`.

This is where the DSL stops being data and starts touching the rig, so it
sits above `model` (pure clause algebra) and below `runner` (which owns
the loop and the run-wide state). The split is what keeps `model`
importable from anywhere.

Four kinds, and the difference is not cosmetic:

    GestureStep   one MCP call — the rehearsed physical action
    WaitStep      an in-process sleep, then one assertion
    GotoStep      a jump: reads a page, and either skips forward to its
                  mark or walks on
    MarkStep      where the jump lands; walked to, its guard (the goto's
                  page) checks the span reached it

`expect` lives on `WaitStep` alone, as a field rather than a validation
rule, so "expect is wait-only" is a fact about the type instead of a
check someone could forget to run. It is wait-only because a gesture's
own view is captured ~2s after the touch and is the SAME frame the next
step's guard reads for free — an `expect` there would assert nothing new.

Every `execute` returns a `StepOutcome` rather than raising, because a
mid-run failure is a substantive result the agent must read (with the
screen to work from), not an error to retry.
