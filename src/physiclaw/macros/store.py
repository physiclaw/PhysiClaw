"""Macro discovery and the `## Available Macros` prompt section.

One file per macro under ``~/.physiclaw/macros/``: ``<name>.yml``, the
stem IS the identity and the file's ``name`` field must match (a macro
owns no other files, so it is a leaf, not a folder). Only ``*.yml`` is
scanned, so the machine-written ``stats.json`` and the format
``README.md`` at the root can never be read as a macro.

Discovery is realpath-scoped like `engine.skill`: a symlinked file that
escapes the root is rejected. A file failing validation is excluded whole
with its reason kept on the ScanEntry — `physiclaw macros check` prints
it; the engine only ever sees valid AND enabled specs.
