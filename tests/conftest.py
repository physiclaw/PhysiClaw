"""Top-level pytest fixtures and import-time isolation.

Two non-obvious pieces:

1. **`PHYSICLAW_HOME` is read once at `physiclaw.paths` import time** (line:
   `HOME = Path(os.environ.get("PHYSICLAW_HOME", "~/.physiclaw")).expanduser()`).
   We set it at module load, before any test or fixture runs, so the first
   `import physiclaw` resolves `paths.HOME` to a session-scoped tmp dir
   instead of the real `~/.physiclaw`.

2. **Per-test isolation** — the autouse `physiclaw_home` fixture re-points
   `paths.HOME` and `paths.LOG_DIR` to a per-test tmp dir, so tests that
   write under HOME don't bleed state across each other.
