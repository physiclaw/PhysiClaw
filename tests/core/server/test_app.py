"""Tests for `physiclaw.core.server.app` — application assembly.

Importing the module has side effects: it constructs the singleton
PhysiClaw + bridge state, attaches the bridge, and wires every
register_* function onto the FastMCP instance. These tests verify the
wiring without re-importing (which would fight pytest's import cache).
