"""Tests for `physiclaw.core.server.mcp` — FastMCP instance.

The module reads `PHYSICLAW.md` from disk at import time and constructs
a `FastMCP("physiclaw", instructions=...)`. The instructions string is
sent to MCP clients at the initialization handshake — verifying it
loads correctly and isn't empty matters for cross-tool reasoning.

Note on imports: `physiclaw.core.server.mcp` (the module) gets shadowed
by `physiclaw.core.server.mcp` (the FastMCP instance) once
`physiclaw.core.server.__init__` runs. We use `importlib.import_module`
to get the module object reliably.
